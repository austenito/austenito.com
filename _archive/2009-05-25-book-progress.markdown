 1. [Clean Code: A Handbook of Agile Software Craftsmanship (Robert C. Martin Series)][1]  (Finished!) 
 2. [Outliers: The Story of Success][2]  (Finished!) 
 3. [Design Patterns: Elements of Reusable Object-Oriented Software (Addison-Wesley Professional Computing Series)][3]  (In Progress!) 
 4. [House of Leaves][4]  
 5. [Mentoring: The Tao of Giving and Receiving Wisdom][5]  
 6. [The Bro Code][6] 

I enjoyed reading Clean Code. The best part about it was it changed my outlook on method and class 
construction. My code is _a lot_ cleaner. The last chapter in the book, "Smells and Heuristics", is 
something all developers should read. I plan on giving it to developers on my company's engineering team.
Next on the reading list is the GoF book. It's interesting to come back to a book years later. A quick 
scan through the patterns shows me that I have forgotten a bunch. I can't wait to get through it again. 
The GoF book is great. I'll write more as a I plow through it.

Also Google Summer of Code is ramping up. 

Time to get to work!
