[Rands][1] says that you should update your resume every 6 months regardless if you are looking for a new job or not. I haven't updated my resume in a couple of years, so this was a pretty interesting exercise. Updating your resume let's you figure out what you've done and where you are heading. So that's what I did tonight. Let's see what I learned...

**What I did:**

I spent a lot of time working on Hackystat. This is a good thing since I learned about Java, Ant, XML, JAXB, Postgres, and SQL.

I had one line about my work project. I'm not sure if that's a good thing, but I have learned quite a bit from my work experience.

I worked *A LOT* on the software development platform at work. My work experience section for my job is mostly about setting up out continious integration build server, working on our Ant build scripts, code reviews and mentoring interns. I was debating if I should put some information on trying to start a Wiki usage movement at work, but I decided against it since it didn't really pan out.

I was actually surprised that I had enough "Volunteering" items to put on my resume. I have to thank [Aaron][2] for that one.

**Where I'm going:**

This one was a tough one. I'm looking at my resume and it isn't clear where I'm headed. It seems that I'm interested in hacking for fun. Maybe mentor students and help developers grow or something. Looking at my resume I don't get that "ah hah" that's where he's headed.

But there's hope!Even though [OpenMBP][3] isn't on my resume, I'm pretty sure it's the direction I'm headed. I want to build software that's useful to people. I want them to enjoy using software that I've been working on. Development on that project is starting to ramp up so I hopefully in the next resume revision I'll be able to add a new OpenMBP resume item with Ruby on Rails, Git, and an URL to the released version of our software. I think that's a good goal to have.

I really feel that I haven't done enough in the past two years. Before I started updating my resume, I was thinking that I would have lots of things to add. It turns out that I didn't really add all that much. I added some things about my work project, extra activities like Hackystat and volunteering, but it all felt a bit lacking. I couldn't add anything about the books and blogs I'm reading, the blogs I'm writing. I guess resumes are a way for companies to weed through people and find who they *really* want to interview. It looks like I'm going to have to work harder in the next six months to put things on my reusme that make me stand out.

[Revolutionary Improvement][4] perhaps?
