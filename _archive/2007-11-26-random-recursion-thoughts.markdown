I was thinking about recursion earlier today so I decided to do some snooping around.  [Wikipedia ][1] has a nice section on recursion.  Back in my college days, I learned a nifty little language called Scheme.  Some of my classmates totally hated that language.  They had trouble getting around the huge amounts of nested parentheses and the endless horde of recursion.  Recursion here, recursion there, car, cdr, cdr, car.  (Don't worry I also forgot what car and cdr mean in Scheme)  In my opinion,  recursion is awesome.  I don't use it very often in practice, but I learned how to think about function calls by learning recursion. I heard some one say that that Scheme is a lot like Lisp.  I know that the authors of [Xkcd][2]  think that it is a godly language.[![][3] ][4] After researching a bit, I did some simple recursion problems.  Reversing characters, computing numbers, etc.  It made me miss recursion...I wonder what students are learning today.  Has recursion been phased out?
