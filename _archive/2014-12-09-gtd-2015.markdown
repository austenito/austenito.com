# What happened in 2014?

Here's what happened in 2014! I'm happy with all of the things I've done and experienced. I had
5 friends me in 2014. Only 1 friend visited me while I was living in DC. 2015 is going to be 
crazytown with a ton of travel! Get excite.

# Completed

Like always, let's check out what I completed in 2014:

* **52 week money challenge** - I actually didn't finish this challenge, however I
stopped doing it because I decided to use all the cash to pay my movers since there
really was no purpose in having that much cash on hand.

* **Apply to speak at a conference** - I applied to RailsConf and didn't get in.

* **Travel to Paris at the end of the year** - After much procrastination, I bought a ticket
and I'm going in March!

* **Sign up and complete the WSET advanced course** - Thinking about this more, 
I decided to not take the class and focus on tasting more wines. I am focusing
my learning on every bottle I drink since that's what I care about. I 
much rather spend the money on wines than the class.

* **Contribute to another open source library** - I made my own library and coded a lot
on my clone of the trackyourhappiness.org. I did a pretty good job coding everyday 
and doing the 365 github project. I found coding everyday to be amazingly difficult, 
especially when waiting to code at the end of the day. If I went out at all, 
my coding streak would be in jeopardy. (It was)

* **Pick up a new hobby** - I was heavily into wine this past year. It's my new hobby!

# Not Completed

And less exciting, what I didn't finish:

* **52 week food challenge** - This one ended pretty early. I ran into some ingredients 
that I didn't want to use and I fell behind.

* **Continue practicing French lessons in DuoLingo** - I've done this off and on this
whole year. I found I like doing the lessons on the train, however the app doesn't
keep a large enough cache to work through lessons on the train. I want it to cache
the entire lesson right when I start it.

* **Add physical photos and cards to an album** - I still have all of my pictures
in a box.

* **Read 3 wine books** - I read Adventures on the Wine Route and read half of the 
Judgement of Paris. I absolutely loved Adventures on the Wine Route and found 
the Judgement of Paris to be boring.

# Goals for this year

* **Post 1 bottle every other week on my [wine blog](http://wine.austenito.com)** - I learned a lesson that 1 bottle of wine
a week equals drinking a whole bottle in two days. This makes it pretty hard to do anything
on those nights. I think I can do one bottle every other week and learn some cool things.

* **Complete WSET Intermediate Course** - Looks like I might get this paid for! :D

* **Buy a ticket to another foreign country** - This is TBD on where I want to go. It will depend on
how much I love/hate my Paris trip. Some places I'm thinking about are Florence, Milan, Casablanca,
or somewhere in Spain.

* **Travel to the Finger Lakes and visit vineyards** - I really want to go upstate and learn what's outside
of the city.

* **Visit Boston and watch a baseball game at Fenway** - I've been wanting to visit Boston since I was living in 
DC. This year is the year!

* **Apply to speak at another conference** - I have a career goal of speaking at a conference. The hard part is
thinking of a topic.

* **Buy this [watch][1]** - It's about time to get a high quality daily timepiece.

* **Buy a piece of art for my apartment** - I really like my apartment and what to make it feel more like home. I was
thinking about getting a ukiyo-e piece with a snow landscape.

* **Build a terrarium** - I originally wanted to grow a bonsai, however it's too much maintenance and work
for something I want to keep in my apartment.

To 2015!
