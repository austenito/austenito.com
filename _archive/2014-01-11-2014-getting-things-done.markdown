# Looking back on 2013

I love going back in time to read posts I've written a year ago. It's interesting
to see what state of mind I was in when I wrote those posts. At the
start of 2013, I wanted to focus on things that weren't related to programming. I
wanted to experience what D.C. had to offer. Here's what I completed:

### Completed

2. Smithsonian Aerospace Museum - I went there with Alan when he came to visit.
8. Trout fly fishing - Fishing with my hungries
9. Camping in the mountains - It was like camping except in a cabin.
11. Snowboading - I went to Tahoe with the Moruns!
18. Eat at Ray's Hell Burger - Delciousness!
19. Participate in an introductory online French course - DuoLingo!

#### Techincal Goals

* Contribute to an open source library. - Ruby Resty!
* Volunteer at CodeNow - Flew all over the place helping CodeNow!
* Compete in hackathons - StartupBus and TechCrunch disrupt in the bag

### Incomplete

1. Eat at Sushi Taro
3. NFL Game
4. NHL Game
5. NBA game
6. MLS game
7. Black Friday Shopping
10. Watch the fireworks on the Mall
12. Visit the National Zoo
13. Visit the Newseum
14. FRENCH LAUNDRY OMG - I failed on getting reservations
15. Add physical photos and cards to an album
16. Read 3 wine books - I read Secrets of Sommeliers.
17. Flavor Profiling
20. Watch a baseball game at Fenway.

#### Techincal Goals

* Re-write Playlistdio with Rails and a relational database.
* Finish a super secret game clone.
* Go to DC tech meetups

So what does this mean? I only completed a small portion of the things I wanted to do in 2013.
Well, 2013 wasn't a total wash. I did some amazing things like the StartupBus, the
Firefly Music Festival, Visit NYC a ton, learning that flying home twice in a month
for a weekend is nuts, and don't forget moving to NYC.

Maybe I shouldn't be so hard on myself? :)

# Onwards to 2014!

So what do I want to do this year? What will be my focus? And more importantly,
how do I complete my goals?

I want my focus this year to be similar to last year with an emphasis on activites
and techincal goals as secondary. I want to travel more, read more, save more. I also
want to have bigger goals.The second question is a little more difficult. How 
can I keep myself in check? The thing that comes to mind is to put all of my 
goals onto a trello board and check in.

* [52 week money challenge][1] - The idea behind this is to save the dollar amount
equal to the index of the year's week. $1 for week 1, $2 for week 2. Seems easy to
do. I've already started this by putting money into an envelope.

* [52 week food challenge][2] - Cooking and food is a huge part of my life. I want
to experiement with different ingredients.

* Apply to speak at a conference - I'm putting this one out there.

* Travel to Paris at the end of the year.

* Continue practicing French lessons in DuoLingo

* Visit Calgary

* Contribute to another open source library.

* Sign up and complete the WSET advanced course

* Add physical photos and cards to an album

* Read 3 wine books

* Pick up a new hobby - I constantly think about wanting to learn a new skill
or pick up something that's fun that I normally don't do. Now I need to find
something.

Woohoo!
