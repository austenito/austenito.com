Over the past couple weeks, I was [getting interviewed by Aaron][1]. This was the first time I have been interviewed outside of a job setting. After going through the process, I think that interviews are a good way of thinking about where you are in your career, what you need to improve on, and what you should strive for. The interview process is a lot like [revisiting your resume every six months][2] (which I still have not gotten around to doing). Here are some observations I had about getting interviewed:

1. Having extra time to gather your thoughts for an answer is a great exercise. Every question that Aaron asked required me to stop and think about an answer that expressed how I feel. It also made re-evaluate my reasoning behind my answers. I was happy to find that I couldn't find answers to some of his questions because I now have a concrete starting point to think about where I want to go. 

2. The interview questions should be focused on a certain area of be effective. In Aaron's interview, he asked me how I got started, what I like about developing software now, and where I want to do later. I liked how he made me think about several aspects in my career. If he didn't ask me the right questions, I wouldn't be thinking about the right things. 

3. Using back-and-forth emails to interview a person is better than I thought. I originally thought it would be better to just send one email with a whole bunch of questions. After doing this interview, where I spent long periods of time just thinking of an answer, I was glad that each email only had one question. It felt like I was accomplishing something and I didn't half-ass the end portion of the interview. 

4. Self-introspection is fun! You get to learn about yourself. It's interesting when you learn new things about someone you should know the best.


I definitely recommend getting interviewed. It was a great experience that I want to have again in the near future. It is actually very easy to get interviewed. Just ask a friend, neighbor, colleague to think of themselves at a bar having a few drinks with you. After everyone is feeling good, fire away with the questions. Its a relaxed atmosphere with absolutely no pressure. All upside, no downside. Anyone want to get interviewed by me?
