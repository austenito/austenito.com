I think Eric Sink got it right. <br /><br /><a href="http://www.ericsink.com/No_Programmers.html">We Need Developers, Not Programmers</a>. <br /><br />In the article, he writes about needing developers who know how to be flexible and understand the software lifecycle instead of coders that are one trick ponies. &nbsp;You know who I'm talking about. &nbsp;Those programmers who know how to write some source and nothing else. &nbsp;Improve the build environment? Work on continuos integration? &nbsp;Unit test? &nbsp;Write wikis to help the team? Mentor? &nbsp;Contribute to the awesome company culture? Forget about it.<br /><br />Working for a small company, I completely agree with that statement. &nbsp;I'm glad that I work at a company that allows me to have a hand in everything. &nbsp;My tasks during the week range from development environment scripting to application deployment to middleware hacking to pretty front end stuff to ensuring code quality to maintaining our build server. &nbsp;<b>Then</b>&nbsp;I get to write down what I've done to help out the rest of the team on our company wiki. &nbsp;My hard work is rewarded with my #1 status&nbsp;on the&nbsp;<a href="http://wiki.hudson-ci.org/display/HUDSON/The+Continuous+Integration+Game+plugin">Continuos Integration Game</a>&nbsp;leaderboard. &nbsp;Having my hand in everything is awesome because<br /><br /><b>I'm learning tons everyday!</b><br /><br /><b></b>As a developer, that's something to strive for. Especially if you're a developer that's fresh out of school. &nbsp;When you get out of college, you want to absorb as much as possible. &nbsp;Can you do that at a big company? &nbsp;Maybe. &nbsp;Is it easier at a smaller company? &nbsp;Totally. <br /><br />As a developer, you have a mound of responsibilities other than whipping out lines of source. &nbsp;Specializing in something is great, but being an agile developer is much more useful to your peers. &nbsp;If you understand the different aspects of software, you can apply your knowledge to challenges you face in every facet of development. &nbsp;I've learned over the years that just being familiar with what people are talking is <b>HUGE</b>. &nbsp;It gives you a basis when you start learning new stuff on <a href="http://www.google.com/">The Google</a>. &nbsp;The only way to get to that nice and comfy "I've heard of that before" place is to dive into as many new things as possible.<br /><br />Staying agile is important and a small company helps you do that. &nbsp;It helps you and your team <i>get things done</i>.<br /><br />And isn't that what it's all about? <br /><br />Solving problems, improving customers lives, and rocking out to an awesome product. <br /><br /><div><span class="Apple-style-span" style="font-family: 'Lucida Grande'; font-size: small;"><span class="Apple-style-span" style="font-size: 11px;"><br /></span></span></div></div>
