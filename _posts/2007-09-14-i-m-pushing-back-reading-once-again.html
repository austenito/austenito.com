So rather than read a few extra pages of <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Professional-Software-Development-Schedules-Successful/dp/0321193679/ref=pd_bbs_5/002-5141950-8497658?ie=UTF8&s=books&amp;qid=1189765216&sr=8-5">Steve McConnell's Professional Software Development</a>, I'm writing a blog.  It's so hard these days to find the time to read in-between work hacking, Hackystat hacking, and my new man-crush, blogging.  <a href="http://kagawaa.blogspot.com/">Aaron</a> pointed me to a new book that I immediately ordered from Amazon.  It's called <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Software-Creativity-2-0-Robert-Glass/dp/0977213315">Software Creativity 2.0</a> and it looks very promising.  Robert Glass has written some very good books including the "<a href="http://books.google.com/books?id=3Ntz-UJzZN0C&amp;pg=PP1&dq=inauthor:Robert+inauthor:L+inauthor:Glass&amp;sig=tFGSkbLuKt3ZZIzxJq-hcWRfqlY#PPR7,M1">F-book</a>".  Why is it called the "F-book?"  Perhaps you need to read it or you can see the obvious and figure it out for yourself.<br /><br />So the creativity book by Robert Glass contains a forward by Tom DeMarco the co-author of Peopleware.  (I'm not going to link it because the 2 people that actually read this blog know the awesomness known as Peopleware).  Top that off with a amazon.com review by Steve McConnell and you have one hell of a book to look forward to.<br /><br /><br />With my spontaneous purchase of Software Creativity, I began thinking about what I should be reading.  In my amazon wishlist, I have a bunch of books in a range of topics.  These topics include Java, Ruby, design patterns, agile practices, interface design, and general motivation and creativity books.  I normally try to buy 2 books from amazon at a time for the free shipping and to vary what I read.  Normally I get a tech book and generic "how to become awesome" book, but I always wonder if I should be focusing on certain things.  Maybe I should be focusing on improving my Java 1 billion % or perhaps I should get all the Ruby books I can because it just might be the next big thing.  It is pretty hard to read everything nowdays, so I really have to be selective.  I wonder how all you big readers / hackers / workers / parents get it done.  I think I'm going to sleep now, but what a waste.  I could be reading or hacking or blogging more. <br /><br />How do we petition to increase the amount of hours in a day to 48?</div>
