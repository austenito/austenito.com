title: "Mini-Feed Webservice Making a Comeback?"

<div class='post'>
The Hackystat Mini-Feed has hit a road block.  A Mini-Feed webservice may be the answer.<br /><br /><span style="font-weight: bold;">What I want to do</span><br /><br />I had the idea that the mini-feeds should display some aggregated information based on batches of the sensor data entries.  This will allow the feed to say things like:<br /><br /><blockquote style="font-style: italic;">Austen currently has 25 minutes of active time in the past hour.  2 hours total for today.<br /><br />@ 12:02pm Austen has invoked an ant build.<br /><br />@ 4:04pm Philip has run the Emma Coverage tool.  The foo module currently has 99.9% method level coverage.<br /><br />@2:02am Aaron has commited 25 files.</blockquote><br /><span style="font-weight: bold;">The Problem</span><br /><br />The issue I had tonight was the large amount of webservice requests required to get the right data.  There are basically two ways to request project data in Hackystat.   [1] Request the index of sensor data entries, which provides you with information such as the URL to the entries' representation, a timestamp, sdt, user, etc.  [2] Use the URL found in the index to drill down into the entities' representation.<br /><br />To implement the Mini-Feed, I need to drill down into the entities' representation to get the entries' runtime and data type specific stuff. <br /><br />For those of you wondering what the difference between timestamps and runtime are, timestamps are unique to all data entries.  It acts as the 'primary key' of an entry.  A runtime can exist in multiple entries and provides a way to 'batch' data together.  An example of a batch of data would be all of the entries associated with an unit test tool's execution.  Each batch would have information about the unit test's execution, such as whether or not a test passed or failed.<br /><br />Drilling down into each data entry is time-consuming due to the large number of data entries.  If the index has 5000 entries, I will have to make 5000 separate requests to get the entry specific information.  My tests of performing 3000 or so web requests to my local sensorbase took about 45 seconds to complete.  Thats just too long.  I think the overhead of making all those requests is causing the slowdown.  Thats my theory anyways...<br /><br /><br /><span style="font-weight: bold;">The solution?</span><br /><br />So I was thinking "How come the DailyProjectData services don't have that problem too?"  I believe the reason is that there is only one webservice call binding each entries' data to Java objects.<br /><br />So in order to remove the large amount of requests I will have to create a Mini-Feed service that can talk directly to the SensorBaseClient.   I am wondering if caching will get rid of this problem.  If so, I probably should hold off on writing a Mini-Feed service.</div>

i guess philip is saying you do need an independent service that polls on a timer. got it?</div>

Hi Austen,<BR/><BR/>Very cool idea!  I don't think you should wait for caching, I think you should go ahead and implement the system right now.  Remember that the "wait" is going to occur in an independently running service, so even if things take a while, you as a user won't even notice.  <BR/><BR/>The other way to improve scalability is to think of data retrieval this way:  each hour, the service wakes up, and asks for only the data that arrived in the previous hour.  This data is inspected to determine if anything of interest should go to the facebook page. When done, it goes to sleep until the next hour. <BR/><BR/>Finally, the direction you're heading suggests a more generalized idea for a service I'm nicknaming Boswell:<BR/><BR/>http://groups.google.com/group/hackystat-dev/browse_thread/thread/122feeef99d826ae<BR/><BR/>Looking forward to your comments and thoughts on it!<BR/><BR/>Cheers,<BR/>Philip</div>
