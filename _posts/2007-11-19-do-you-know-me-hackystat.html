James turned me on to a streaming music website called <a href="http://pandora.com/">Pandora</a>.  Great website.  Good music.  Nice eye candy.  If you haven't been to Pandora before, I will break it down for you.  They allow you to give a thumbs up or thumbs down to currently streaming song in the genre of your choice.  From there they do some "music selection magic" and select a different song that usually is something you'll like.  They probably use similar ratings from other users with the same musical tastes.  So far I'm really happy with Pandora.  I'm hearing bands I've never heard of before that I'm starting to like.  But the most interesting part of Pandora is the feeling I get when I'm logged on.  It's uncanny.  I feel like Pandora knows me.  With music selections, <span style="font-style: italic;">it feels like it knows who I am</span>.<br /><br />With all the social networking, open social, and collective intelligence talk floating around the internet, I have been thinking that it would be cool if Hackystat would go further and try to  "understand the people behind the metrics."  We currently collect project data and developer data to a certain extent.  From there we infer certain things like the health and direction of project or a developer's activities.  What we don't do is analyze the people responsible for the direction of the project.  There are many negative issues surrounding the use of developer metrics to analyze people.  A big thing is that there is no way to accurately represent who a developer is with the data that is collected.  There are just too many intagibles behind software development.  Using developer level metrics in a scientifically proven way is hard and we have not solved that problem yet.  But what if we did?<br /><br />Would more people embrace Hackystat if there was a way for people to relate to the their own data?  Maybe their is some type of hidden disconnect between the metrics and people.  I know that I personally don't log onto Hackystat and say, "Wow this tool really reflects who I am as a developer."  Is that really useful?  I don't know, but wouldn't it be awesome if you could feel the same type of emotional connection just like when Pandora starts playing another awesome song (which it did just now).<br /><br />Developer level metrics are interesting.  I hope we can find an interesting and useful way to utilize it.</div>
