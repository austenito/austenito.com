I'm big on increasing my productivity and workflow. As a new developer, it's easy to be overwhelmed 
by new concepts, deadlines, shipping 2 hours before a project is due. Let's be honest, we make it 
harder on ourselves than need be.

Here is a list of tools I use everyday to streamline my work day.

# Tools

* [Alfred][1] - More options than spotlight, faster, and you can have custom workflows.
* [RescueTime][2] - Monitors what apps and websites you visit.
* [Pomodoro][3]
* [Omnifocus][4] - For all devices (Phone, Mac, iPad)
* [Vim with a custom dotfiles][5] - Who needs the mouse?
* [tmux][6] 
* [Divvy][7]
* [Fantastical][8]
* [Evernote][9]
* [Pocket][10]
* [ITerm 2][11]
* [Vimimum][12]
* [Trello][13]
* [1Password][14]
* [Oh My Zsh][15]
* [autojump][16]
* [IFTTT Recipes][21] - For example, I use recipes to send all HackerNews articles with 150+ points to Pocket
* [AirMail][22]

# Techniques

Tools are important and help you get things done. However, I believe where people fall flat is with
their discipline and process. Having a good process that you stick to everyday is the key to crushing
your day.

Here is what I do every week.

* [Getting Things Done (GTD)][18] - The GTD workflow in combination with Omnifocus has been by far 
the most productivity boosting workflow and tool combination. The learning curve is high, however 
you can blow through your TODO items when you understand the process.
* [Inbox Zero][19] - I hate checking email. I hate the little icon displaying how many email 
messages I have right this second. I use AirMail to check my email a few times a day. When I clear 
out my inbox, I close the app. I have even played with only checking email on my phone to force 
myself to avoid contstantly checking who sent me what.
* Check email a _only_ few times a day
* [Pomodoro Technique][20] - I mainly use this to jumpstart my day. When I get to work, I do a 
few pomodoros to get me into the programming groove.
* Remapping Control to Caps Lock - As coders we shouldn't be moving our pinkys all the way down to hit Control.
* Weekly Reviews - This might be one of the most important steps that I do weekly. I review all of 
the tasks in Omnifocus to verify they are still relevant and check what I actually was doing on RescueTime. 
Once I have some data on what I want to do and what I did, I can adjust myself going forward.

My workflow isn't perfect and is by no means an exhaustive list. I am constantly iterating on my 
process and adding new tools. When I visit other people's workstations or see them using their phone, 
I always ask what apps or tools they use. I love to hear how other people do their everyday things.
