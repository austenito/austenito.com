I've been attempting to write code everyday like [John Resig](http://ejohn.org/blog/write-code-every-day/)
and have found it to be an awesome experience. I feel I'm learning a lot about myself as the journey continues.
Here's my current 8 week graph:

What I really like about this project besides working in short sprints instead of marathon coding sessions
is looking back on the nights I _didn't_ commit. For example, in this commit, I learned the hard way that 
I need to be committing to master instead of a branch to get credit.

Sometimes I've found that missing commits are OK if there is a good reason, like planning things for Goruco:

And finally, sometimes I really need to just come home instead of staying out:

Another thing that I've learned in the 8 weeks is not to be too hard on myself. This challenge isn't about
coding 365 days in a row. It's about doing something I love everyday to get better, just like 
[Mr. Seinfeld](http://www.writersstore.com/dont-break-the-chain-jerry-seinfeld/).
