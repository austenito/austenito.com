<a href="http://www.ubuntu.com/">Ubuntu</a>.  Dual Monitor Display.  Happiness.<br /><br />I'm sitting here writing this blog anxiously waiting for my laptop to finish defragging so I can shrink my windows partition with <a href="http://gparted.sourceforge.net/">gParted</a>.  I tried to partition it early without defragging, but I got an error so I'm sitting here doing nothing while its takes >2 hours to complete. <br /><br />I used to run an earlier Ubuntu distro on my desktop (Breezy I believe) and it was an awesome.  Hacking on linux is absolutely one step towards being productive and getting things done.  Linux sometimes pisses me off since some of my hardware doesn't work, but every new release of Ubuntu fixes something that wasn't compatible.  I remember the days when the only solution to get my wireless adapter to work was to write my own drivers.  Hacking + Linux is great.  Here is why I think you should switch.<br /><br /><ul><li>Fast file system.  ext3 > NTFS.   This is an absolute must-have when compiling.  I remember way back in Hackystat 6 and 7 where compiling on linux would be up to 5 minutes faster than windows.<br /><br /></li><li>Multiple desktop support.  Let's face it.  Windows has crappy multiple desktop support.  I tried <a href="http://www.microsoft.com/windowsxp/downloads/powertoys/xppowertoys.mspx">Microsoft Power Tools</a>, a free app that let's you have multiple desktops.  Crap.  Slow.  Not configurable.    Aaron informs me that he has had multiple desktop support with his other computer.  Sadly it was tied to his ATI video card.  No dice. <br /><br />As a hacker you need lots of screen real-estate.  So much that you would need gigantic monitors to fit everything you want.  Multiple desktops let you have Eclipse open, multiple consoles, a text editor, browsers, instant messengers, twitter, your mail client, downloads, all open at the same time.  You set up your environment so you know exactly what desktop screen the app you lives on.  You move fast.  You have to or else the IM blinking won't stop.<br /><br /></li><li>A useful shell.  To make you hacking life easier, you need to be able to grep the output of your app, pipe some information to a file, or just be able to copy and paste without using the stupid "mark" option in the Windows shell. <br /></li></ul><br />Linux is awesome.  When it works.  Some people complain about their hardware not working or just not having the same amount of software choices.  I feel their pain.  Linux is not for the weak.  It grinds you until you want to just give up.  Then you find this post about someone who wrote a script that fixes some obscure file that was causing your install script to fail.  Hooray.  Some people don't want to deal with that.  I had enormous amounts of trouble setting up dual monitors in previous releases.  That and my special <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Kensington-Expert-Mouse-Optical-Trackball/dp/B00009KH63">Kensington Expert Mouse</a> doesn't work.  I too sometimes that Linux would just work.<br /><br />If you know how much of a pain setting up dual monitors was, you'll be happy to know that setting it up with Gutsy is supposedly easier.  No more xorg.conf hacking.  So I have heard.  54% completed.  Compacting files.  46% more until I can leave you windows.<br /><br />So long and thanks for all the fish.</div>
