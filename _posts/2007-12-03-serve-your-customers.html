<p class="MsoNormal"><o:p></o:p><i style="">The ability to accept feedback from *anybody*.<span style="">  </span>I find the best feedback comes in the "customer is always right" sense, where the intern is a "customer" of your design. If they feel like something is more complicated than it ought to be, there's a reasonable chance they are right, even though their identification of the "root problem" may be laughably wrong. And even if they are completely wrong and it really does have to be that complex, a humble designer should not immediately resort to "Because I said so", but should at least try to explain why. <o:p></o:p></i></p>  <p class="MsoNormal"><o:p> - </o:p><a href="http://www.codinghorror.com/blog/archives/000051.html">http://www.codinghorror.com/blog/archives/000051.html</a></p>  <p class="MsoNormal">With a new member on my team at work, I gave him a task to implement a new feature for an upcoming milestone.<span style="">  </span>He was to use code that I wrote to implement a new feature.<span style="">  </span>After spending some time learning how the code works, he came up to me and said, “<span style="font-style: italic;">Austen, isn’t there an easier way to do this?</span>”<span style="">  </span>After explaining to him the reason why things are they way they are, he trodded off and churn out more code.<span style="">  </span>Once again he came back to me a bit later saying, “<span style="font-style: italic;">I’ve been using your API and here are the areas that I am having a problem with.</span>”<span style="">  </span>I wondered what was wrong.<span style="">  </span>I had no problems using my own code.

Hi, my name is Timothy Tang and I have just completed the book, "Real answers to The Meaning of Life and finding Happiness".  <BR/><BR/>Many people feel that the interpretation to The Meaning of Life question is too subjective to have any definite objective answer but I have managed to formulate a real and objective answer based on facts to the ultimate question of human existence. <BR/><BR/>The book also sheds light on a new understanding of emotions such as Anger, Fear, Guilt, and Love.<BR/><BR/>I have made a blog that introduces the book. Do check it out. <BR/><BR/>http://ultimatemeaningoflife.blogspot.com</div>
