It seems that 3 weeks after writing&nbsp;<a href="http://austenito.blogspot.com/2009/11/paying-myself-first.html">Paying Myself First</a>, I have already failed. &nbsp;Well not completely.<br /><br />I haven't been writing down my thoughts in blog form because I've been preparing slides for a tech talk at work. &nbsp;I've been wanting to give a talk about <a href="http://mockito.org/">Mockito</a>. &nbsp;My project is on a transition point so I figured that it would be imperative to give a talk this month before we ramp up again in January.<br /><br />I suck at public speaking. &nbsp;That process of reading your audience. &nbsp;Conveying information. &nbsp;All of that <i>stuff</i>. &nbsp;Who needs it right? &nbsp;Hook me up with my IDE, give me a fridge full of diet mountain dew and get out of my way. &nbsp;I got things to do. <br /><br />If only the world worked that way.<br /><br />Since I'm on this whole, let's work hard and do awesome kick, I've been looking at public speaking as an area to focus on. &nbsp;After all, if I want to be able to lead software teams, I need to be able to be someone who is able to be informative and also know what the hell they are talking about. &nbsp;I've done the whole Toastmasters thing before. &nbsp;I like the concept, but I didn't like the structure and organization of the particular group I was a part of. &nbsp;So without any outside help, I got to searching on how I could improve my slides and effectively present&nbsp;a technical presentation to my peers.<br /><br />And the search began.<br /><br />I found this interesting PDF using the Google:&nbsp;<a href="http://www.home.hs-karlsruhe.de/~kech0001/ifs/ex-en/tech_exercises/Technical_English_presentations.pdf">Presentation Tips - How to Give a Technical Presentation</a>. &nbsp;It's main points were to break up your presentation into distinct beginning, middle, and end sections. &nbsp;The normal presentation layout, which I totally brainfarted on. &nbsp;My presentation sections were a mess. &nbsp;I didn't show any importance, background, or motivation in the beginning. &nbsp;I had no illustrations to help my audience during the meat of my presentation. &nbsp;The end was the best part, most likely because the slides came to end. <br /><div style="margin-bottom: 0px; margin-left: 0px; margin-right: 0px; margin-top: 0px;"><br /></div><div style="margin-bottom: 0px; margin-left: 0px; margin-right: 0px; margin-top: 0px;">When I fixed my slides a bit, I changed my presentation's beginning&nbsp;to grab my audience's attention with some facts about my project's level of code coverage.&nbsp;The middle gave the basic functionality of Mockito such as mocking, stubbing and verifying. &nbsp;I added some code examples and gave some background on when and why you would want to use Mockito's features. &nbsp;There were a lot of questions that were brought up during this part of the talk. &nbsp;Some were of mocking and stubbing use-cases and others were related to project specific usages. &nbsp;I got a sense of confusion from the audience at this point. &nbsp;I tried to use the List examples from the Mockito documentation, but that turned out to be a bit too high-level for a presentation. &nbsp;Most of the developers didn't "get it". <br /></div><br />I finished off my presentation with a "real-world" Mockito example where I tested the behavior of a action class populating a stack. &nbsp;The action class implemented ActionListener &nbsp;and would operate on Stack's object interface. &nbsp;I got good responses from this part of the presentation. &nbsp;I think that developers had that "ah hah" moment when they could finally see Mockito in action from an IDE.<br />&nbsp;<br />Overall I think the talk went well. &nbsp;It was very informal and the I was getting a good vibe. &nbsp;The best part was the fun-ness factor. &nbsp;I'd have to give it a 9 out of 10. &nbsp;This was the most fun I have ever had during a tech talk. &nbsp;One thing I noticed that might have increased the fun-ness factor was the room's size. &nbsp;Due to scheduling conflicts we had to switch to another room where the developers were comfortably crammed together. &nbsp;<i>Best move</i> <i>ever</i>. &nbsp;I think that helped the talk out a lot because it made the presentation feel less like a presentation and more like a discussion. &nbsp;I think I'll always have my talks in that room if it's possible.<br /><br />My team has already started to use Mockito to write their unit tests. &nbsp;The real measure of success will be if the rest of the project's teams will start to drink some of that delicious Mockito Koolaid. &nbsp;Oh yeah. &nbsp;A coworker on another project likes the idea of Mockito and believe that he will use it for his tests. &nbsp;Something interesting I ended up telling him was that:<br /><br />"If you already write tests, then you know the pain of trying to setup and build the dependencies of the object you are testing. &nbsp;If you don't write tests then you'll be wondering what's the point".<br /><br />I hope they get it.</div>
