<p class="MsoNormal"><i>Your resume, like your objective, should give me a sense of you and where you're going. I want to see a little ego and I want to see your character because I'm not hiring a flat piece of paper, I'm hiring a person.<br />- <a href="http://www.randsinrepose.com/archives/2007/12/06/a_brief_glimpse.html">Rands in Repose, A Brief Glimpse</a><br /></i><br /><br />After reading <st1:place st="on">Rands</st1:place>' article on how to write a good resume objective, I decided to take a look at my old <a href="http://www2.hawaii.edu/%7Eausten/files/resume.pdf">resume</a>. What I found is a crappy objective statement:<br /><br /><i>To bring my knowledge and experience from research on software engineering processes to the real world; to develop software for a world class software development company.</i><br /><br />Wow. So I want to bring it to the real world huh? And a world class software development company aye? Would it make sense to put, "to develop software for a decent company." No wonder employer's eyes glaze over when they hit the first part of potential candidateâ€™s resumes.<br /><br />After some brainstorming, I worked out a preliminary objective:<br /><br /><i>I need to work in an environment that values developers over products.   When this happens I can write software that is useful and will make a difference.  As a software engineer, I work hard to write quality software.<br /></i><br />This objective says that I want to work somewhere that doesn't impose crazy deadlines and micro-management to get software out the door.  It says that I want to be someplace that gives software engineers interesting problems and turns them loose.  If you want quality software, give me a problem and get out of my way.<i>  </i>This statement definitely needs work, but I think it's a good start.  I think it fits the situation of "sitting at a bar, having a couple drinks, talking about software with a friend."<br /><i><br /></i>I also took a look at the rest of my old resume. I think it's time to wipe the dust off and update it (Stay tuned for an update in another blog).  I need to know where I am now, and where I want to go.<br /><br />No direction + No Awareness = Career Death.</p></div>
