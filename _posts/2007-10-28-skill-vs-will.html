If you haven't noticed yet, I am very big on self-improvement.  I am currently reading a book called <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Managing-Humans-Humorous-Software-Engineering/dp/159059844X">Managing Humans: Biting and Humorous Tales of a Software Engineering Manager</a> by Michael Lopp, who also writes the blog <a href="http://www.randsinrepose.com/">Rands in Repose</a>.  While reading this interesting and witty book, I came across a section called Skill vs. Will.  It explains four states of developers:<br /><ul><li><span style="font-weight: bold;">High skill, low will: </span>Boredom is imminent-needs a change of scenery and responsibility stat.</li><li><span style="font-weight: bold;">High will, low skill: </span>Needs training, needs mentorship.  Needs management.  The good news is they really, really want it.  Savor this because as soon as the skill kicks in, they're going to starting your job.  This rules.</li><li><span style="font-weight: bold;">Low will, low skill: </span>Boy, did you screw up.  It takes a fairly concerted effort to ignore the needs of your employee so long that (a) they no longer have the skills necessary to do their job, and (b) they don't want to do it.  Roll those sleeves up, pal.  You've got work to do.</li><li><span style="font-weight: bold;">High skill, high will:  </span>Great job, ummmm, guess what?  No one stays here long.</li></ul>There are several things that came to mind when I read this section. <br /><ol><li>Why does management screw up if you have low will or low skill?  Isn't it the responsibility of the developer to ensure that they keep up on the latest development styles, techniques, and processes? <br /></li><li>Having a great motivation to learn is a great state of mind to have.  You may not be the best at what you do or know everything, but being motivated gets you half way there.   Improving everyday can only help your chances at becoming awesome.</li><li>He seems to side-step the problem of having low will by saying that by increasing a person's skill, they will also see an increase in their will.  Somehow I don't really buy that.  If you already have low will, what will make you want to increase your skills?  And the larger problem is that if you have low will, what is going to stop you from going back to that state once someone isn't prodding you into improving?<br /></li></ol><br />On a side note:  <a href="http://kagawaa.blogspot.com/">Aaron</a> starred a blog from Coding Horror about <a href="http://www.codinghorror.com/blog/archives/000983.html">achieving blogging success</a>.  That article has inspired me to stick to a blogging plan.  I'm committing myself to blog twice a week, Sundays and Thursdays.  Let's see if I can stick to it for a year.</div>

let me add another dimension. skill vs will vs utilization.  sometimes even the high skill and high will developers are under utilized, restricted, and held back from doing what they do best. <BR/><BR/>managers should look at whether there developers are going full speed ahead, not in productivity but in utilization. <BR/><BR/>stop trying to fit developers in neat square boxes. use a different shaped box. actually, come to think about it. don't even use a "box". don't contain our utilization. <BR/><BR/>a developers motto should be: <I>"give me the requirement and get out of the way".</I> so that means that the managers motto should be: <I>"give them the requirements and get out of their way".</I></div>
