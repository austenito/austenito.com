Do you remember the old Hawaii State Public Library Commericial where kids would say?<br /><blockquote>I am Hawaiian Chinese. &nbsp;I am Hawaiian Portuguese. &nbsp;Please use the library.<br /></blockquote><br />Well I'm not Hawaiian, but&nbsp;I've decided that I'm going to give the library a chance. &nbsp;Up until this point, I told myself that I don't want to use the library. &nbsp;It's such a hassle. &nbsp;Waste of time, energy, resources, and space.<br /><br />I've been reading in personal finance blogs like the&nbsp;<a href="http://www.thesimpledollar.com/">The Simple Dollar</a>&nbsp;about the benefits of using the library. A few of my friends have started or are already using the library. &nbsp;One of even suggested I help to improve the library's borrow/renewal web UI. &nbsp;An interesting side project.<br /><br />But I had my doubts. <br /><ul><li>I know they don't carry the latest technology books</li><li>Driving to and from the library sucks</li><li>Will they have the book I'm looking for?</li><li>I really like to write in my books</li><li>I'm one of those people that have to have to book just in case there is that one time I _really_ want to find something in a book I bought 5 years ago.</li><li>I bet the hours are inconvenient.</li></ul><div>So before I even went down to the library I checked their hours:&nbsp;<a href="http://www.librarieshawaii.org/locations/hours.htm">Hawaii Public State Library Hour of Operation</a><br /></div><div><br /></div><div>Woah. &nbsp;They have decent hours. &nbsp;They are even open till 8 PM on some days. <br /></div><div><br /></div><div>So I headed down one day after work.<br /></div><div><br /></div><div>Here is what I found:<br /><ul><li>If my book is at another branch, I can submit a request online to ship the book to the branch of my choosing.</li><li>It really doesn't take that much time to drive to the library.</li><li>The selection isn't the greatest.</li><li>They still don't carry the latest technology books. &nbsp;</li><li>I still can't write in the books.</li></ul><div>I was quite pleased with my library visit. &nbsp;I had to purchase a new library card because I must have thrown my old card away. &nbsp;When was I ever going to use the library again? &nbsp;So that was $10. &nbsp;It was funny because I had a .90 fine... from 2001. &nbsp;It's been 8 years and they still kept a record of returning a book late. &nbsp;Damn them.<br /></div><br /></div><div><div>But it's okay. &nbsp;I spent $10.90 on my library visit, but I get to have an unlimited amount of books. &nbsp;The money I save from not having to buy books definitely out weighs the time it takes to drive to and from the library. &nbsp;If I reserve my books online I can further reduce the time I spend at the library. &nbsp;Not to mention that I'm saving space because I don't have to store the books. &nbsp;After years of buying books, I notice that my room is cluttered with books that I've read once.<br /></div><div><br /></div><div>Even if the library doesn't have the technical books that will keep me up to date, I still can purchase those books online at Amazon. &nbsp;I add highlighting, notes to my tech books so it's not a huge deal to buy them. &nbsp;I'm thinking I should try to buy them used instead of new. &nbsp;I don't need the new, clean version of the book. &nbsp;The content is the same.<br /><br /><b>The library is awesome!</b><br /><b><br /></b><br /><b><span class="Apple-style-span" style="font-weight: normal;">It's too bad they don't have any funding. &nbsp;When I checked out my books, the librarian handed me a flier that told me about their furlough days. &nbsp;On the other side of the flier there was an article about a fundraiser to support the library. &nbsp;They are obviously in a financial bind.</span></b><br /><br />I'm not sure how to help them. &nbsp;I think donations would help the problem, but would it fix it? &nbsp;Maybe if more people used the library? &nbsp;Who knows, but I'm hoping the library never goes away.<br /></div></div></div>

I need to figure out how long it will take for a book to come in.  It isn&#39;t so bad to wait for the books if you are already reading something.</div>

I also started using the library more myself, several years back.  I almost exclusively use the online reservation system.  If I time it right, I always have a book waiting for me when I&#39;m ready.</div>
