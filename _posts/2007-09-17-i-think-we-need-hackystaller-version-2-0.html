Last night I was preparing for the September 17, 2007 milestone release of XmlData.  Since the last milestone produced problems with the 'ant -f verify.build.xml' invocation and with a missing dependency check of Hackystat_Utilities, I decided to attempt to build from source on my desktop.  My desktop had no Hackystat services or Java code analysis tools.  I spent about 45 minutes getting my environment able to run a 'ant -f verify.build.xml'.  I found that I had to download and configure the environmental variables of all of the tools found at the <a href="http://code.google.com/p/hackystat-sensorbase-uh/wiki/DeveloperGuide">Hackystat-Sensorbase-UH Developer Guide</a>.<br /><br />XmlData requires Sensorshell and Hackystat utilities, which in turn requires Sensorbase.  I hope I never have to format my machine because this takes quite a while.  Hackystat 7 was much easier because all of dependencies (If i remember correctly) were stored in your ant library directory.<br /><br />I'm thinking that eventually we will be needing a tool like HackyInstaller, but something better.  Let's call this tool HackyDevInstaller.  It probably should be able to:<br /><br /><ol><li>Allow the user to choose the source and distribution releases of their Hackystat service(s) of choice.</li><li>Prompt the user to download the modules that the selected services depend on.</li><li>Automatically download the right analysis tools, install them, and allow you to configure the environmental variables.</li><li>It should also manage the user's current installation so they can remove or change their current settings.</li><li>After developing some Ruby on Rails, I found that using <a href="http://instantrails.rubyforge.org/wiki/wiki.pl">Instant Rails</a> was great for quickly starting development.  It would be great if we could start a contained Hackystat development environment that started a local sensorbase service and provided some debugging utilities.<br /></li></ol>Perhaps we can find a NSF Research Grant for Undergraduates for a boy and girl who love hacking.</div>

I think a big part of the pain is having to having to close and re-open the windows shells since there is no  "source .bashrc" or another command to refresh the environmental variables.<BR/><BR/>The pain is great, but you only have to experience the pain every once in a while.  It isn't so bad that I would stop and write a script to help me configure my environment.  It can be tolerated ;)</div>

Hi Austen,<BR/><BR/>I totally agree that installation is currently pretty painful.  I've actually been thinking quite a lot about this issue.  One thing I'd love to avoid is the need to write and maintain an installer package if we can avoid it. <BR/><BR/>My current thought is to create a "super distribution" that contains binary builds of all of the services.  Then, you can download that and you only need to point (relatively) few environment variables at the jar files (basically, one per service).  <BR/><BR/>I'm hoping this will be sufficiently easy for non-developers.   For developers, there's still some initial setup pain and suffering, but you can use  these binaries for all the modules you are not actively working on to minimize the damage.<BR/><BR/>Anyway, that's what I'm thinking at the moment. <BR/><BR/>Cheers,<BR/>Philip</div>
