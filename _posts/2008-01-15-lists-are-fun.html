<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-bottom: 12pt;">I'm a bit late, but I've been reading lists of what people want to accomplish this year and I think it's time to write one of my own.  I personally don't believe in New Year's resolutions since I know I won't keep them, but I've done pretty well with blogging twice a week.  I'm going to see if I can keep up the technical improvements this year.</p>  <ol start="1" type="1"><li class="MsoNormal" style="margin-bottom: 12pt;"><span style="font-weight: bold;">Improve my writing skills</span><br />    Since August I've tried to up keep this blog with technical topics and      personal rants.  Not all of them have been my finest work (actually a      lot of them were horrible), but after making time for this blog, I think      it's a great personal improvement project.  You get to share      ideas with the people that read your blog, work on your writing      skills, and best of all, you can jot down your ideas and thoughts.  I      often have ideas that sound excellent in my head, but I found that things      aren't so clear once you start to talk about it.  I notice that I      come up with these great one sentence ideas for blogs and have trouble writing      3 paragraphs.   Writing it down will help my thinking process. </li><li class="MsoNormal" style="margin-bottom: 12pt;"><span style="font-weight: bold;">Ruby/Apache Wicket and Hackystat</span><br />    This past year I spent time writing a Ping Pong ranking application with      help from Aaron.<span style="">  </span>Learning a      different language was great and I now can talk about design      patterns and technical topics by comparing other languages to Ruby.<span style=""><br /><br /></span>Back when Hackystat 8 was being just      started to be re-written, there was talk of a Ruby interface.<span style="">  </span>We have decided to explore other options      using Ruby or Apache Wicket.<span style="">  </span>The      current interface was written in GWT by David and Pavel, but I think there      was some difficulty developing with GWT.<span style="">       </span>Feel free to talk to them for all the nitty gritty details.<span style="">  </span>Now that we have some new Hackystat      developers coming into the lab, we are going to explore a new      interface.<span style="">  </span>I want to help out      development to become part of the Ruby community ;D<span style="font-family:Wingdings;"><span style=""></span></span>      </li><li class="MsoNormal" style=""><span style="font-weight: bold;">Practice Puzzles</span><br />    One of the themes of this year’s learning will be focused on buffing up      not only my technical abilities, but to work on my thinking power.<span style="">  </span>I will be the first to admit that I am      not the swiftest person out there.<span style="">       </span>I have trouble understanding what people are saying and piecing      things together.<span style="">  </span>I have a hard time      visualizing concepts in my head.<span style="">       </span>That is the main reason I love dry erase markers and white      boards.<span style="">  </span><br /><br />I am thinking I need to      start giving my brain more practice.<span style="">       </span>I’ve decided that I’m going to massage my brain by working on      technical puzzle books.<span style="">  </span>I just      bought <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Puzzles-Programmers-Pros-Dennis-Shasha/dp/0470121688/ref=pd_bbs_sr_1?ie=UTF8&amp;s=books&amp;qid=1200474671&amp;sr=8-1">Puzzles for Programmers and Pros</a> from Amazon and plan to work through it once I      finish reading <a href="http://www.amazon.com/RESTful-Web-Services-Leonard-Richardson/dp/0596529260/ref=pd_bbs_1?ie=UTF8&amp;s=books&amp;qid=1200474723&amp;sr=1-1">RESTful Webservices</a>.<span style="">       </span>Not only will this help me work on my brain power, it will be great      practice for intern and my own interviews.<span style="">  </span>We also have a large Rubik’s cube      contingent at work.<span style="">  </span>I plan on      buying a cube to practice my visualizing skills at home.<br />     <!--[if !supportLineBreakNewLine]--><br />     <!--[endif]--></li><li class="MsoNormal" style=""><span style="font-weight: bold;">Play with Python</span><br />    I don’t really have much to say here.<span style="">       </span>Python is a dynamic language that I’ve some interest in for a      while.<span style="">  </span>I plan on working with a lot      of Ruby this year, so I probably won’t have much time for Python.<span style="">  </span>Getting introduced to it this year is      definitely doable.<span style="">  </span>At the very      least it will satisfy my dynamic language curiosities.<br /><br /></li><li class="MsoNormal" style=""><span style="font-weight: bold;">Buff up my outward and      critical thinking</span><br />    As I mentioned earlier, thinking is not one of my strong points.<span style="">  </span>Aaron often talks about how he looks for      interns that have outward thinking.<span style="">       </span>I am not 100% sure what he means by outward thinking, but I assume      he means that he wants people to think of problems that need to be      solved.<span style="">  People should </span>not only solve their own problems, but think outside of their domain and take a look at other problems to      solve.<span style="">  </span>He wants people to think      critically about things that might spark some interest from others.<span style="">  </span><br /><br />I totally have a deficiency in this      area.<span style="">  </span>I am an inward thinker      meaning I usually think about implementation level details rather than the big      picture.<span style="">  </span>I think critically about      code, process, and software development, but I don’t look at why I’m so      concerned about it all.<span style="">  I really need to </span>take a look at the problem first before      diving in the solution.<span style="">  </span><br />  <br />    I’m not sure how I’m going to tackle this problem this year.<span style="">  </span>Hopefully people can help me along the      way.<span style="">  </span>At the very least, I am aware      of the problem, so that is a good start.<br />     <!--[if !supportLineBreakNewLine]--><br />     <!--[endif]--></li><li class="MsoNormal" style=""><span style="font-weight: bold;">Give a speech to a group      about something in technology</span><br />    I was scheduled to answer questions from Sandy Ho at the <a href="http://www.htdc.org/events/view.asp?ID=1753">HTDC Science and Technology Fair</a> about what      Referentia is looking for and can give to it’s potential employees.<span style="">  </span>Sadly the Q/A session was canceled and      we ended up emailing the answers to her.<span style="">       </span>This year I want to give a speech to a group about what companies      are looking for in their budding software engineers.<span style="">  </span>It would be nice to give a speech to      students at UH and talk about the importance of reading, hacking,      internships, and all the good stuff about software development.<span style="">  </span>Right now I feel that UH has too much      emphasis on theory and not enough on software development (aside from      Philip’s class).<span style="">  </span>It is up to Hawaii's hitech companies to take some initiative and provide internships      that give students the experience necessary for them to succeed.<span style="">  </span>Hopefully I can give a convincing speech      to some people and get them motivated.</li></ol>    <p class="MsoNormal"><o:p><br />Phew.  50 weeks to go.</o:p></p><p class="MsoNormal">Edit.

actually, my comment was that a hackystat research question, hypothesis, and evaluation plan is basically the path for you to accomplish your goals. <BR/><BR/>great goals by the way. good outward thinking.</div>
