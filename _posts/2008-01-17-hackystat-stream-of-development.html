Much like Facebook's Mini Feed, we want to provide awareness to people about what you did, when you did it.<br /><br />The first thing I did was figure out how to request Hackystat data.  For that information I headed over to the <a href="http://code.google.com/p/hackystat-sensorbase-uh/wiki/RestApiSpecification">Hackystat REST API Specification wiki</a> page and took a look at what was available to me.  After a bit of head scratching and help from some fellow Hackystat hackers, I finally found the URI that should provide me with some interesting information.<span style="font-weight: bold;"></span><br /><br />Now that I got past that hurdle, now I can start to think about getting my web application (written in Rails yay!) to parse and display the right information.  There are still a bit of things to think about.<br /><br /><span style="font-weight: bold;">What type of information do we display?</span><br />I was talking to Aaron online tonight and he came up with the idea of just displaying the amount of events that have taken place.  For example, one mini-stream could say, '<span style="font-style: italic;">3 hours total dev time,  50 unit test invocations with 4 failing tests, and 200 builds in the last 2 hours</span>'.<br /><br />Of course that may be enough information for our little data stream, but it would be interesting to get more context behind the collected data.  Perhaps we could start add comments to the mini-feeds?  What if we added some telemetry to the mini-feeds?  That would be cool to see how the mini-feeds turn into a large information feed over time with a telemetry chart.<br /><br /><span style="font-weight: bold;">What type of information should be collected/filtered?</span><br />Currently commit data from Subversion is collected once a day.  I think it would be important to see commit information in the mini-feed.  Committing code is a good indicator of progress so it would be nice to get more up-to-date information with respect to commits.<br /><br />Another metric that we commit once a day is Issue data from JIRA.  It would be good if we could collect that data more often so that we could update the mini-feed with JIRA event information.<br /><br />I think that Filemetric and Code Issue data wouldn't be as useful as UnitTest and Commit information.  I don't really know about this one.  Maybe someone would want to see what kinds of FindBugs errors you have ;)<br /><br /><span style="font-weight: bold;">Cool New Features<br /></span>DrillDown information would be cool because if you find an interesting mini-event, you could click on the event link and see what types of unit test failures are happening or what classes were commited.<span style="font-weight: bold;"><br /></span><br />An RSS feed with the mini-feed information would fit nicely into my Google Desktop app.<br /><br />Commenting on feeds would also be cool.<br /><br />Mini-feed comparisons at the grain size of a day?  Is your mini-feed activity the same during the week the same?<br /><br />Imply information from the data in the mini-feed.  For example, if Aaron and I commit changes to the same module or are running similar unit tests, can we say that we are working together?  '<span style="font-style: italic;">Aaron and Austen have been working on module mini-feed for 2 hours</span>'.  Totally awesome.<br /><br /><insert><br /><br />So fun!</insert></div>

i think it should be like facebooks configuration; basically it allows you to personalize the mini-feed for information that you care about. that could potentially put the user in control of things like granularity, type for each of your friends.</div>

I could see the mini-feed as being part of a twitter "developer-time line".  <BR/><BR/>The only problem is that I would view mini-feed messages as spam after a while.  Tweets have much more value because they aren't auto-generated and can have more context behind the published information.</div>

Excellent!  Looking forward to seeing what you come up with!<BR/><BR/>When I saw this, I thought that the same kind of information would be good to post to Twitter.<BR/><BR/>Then I thought: what are the differences (if any) between the kinds of information you would want to post to the 'mini-feed' and the kinds of information you would post to Twitter? <BR/><BR/>Are there differences in the the communities you are communicating with that affect the information content?  Are there differences in the goal of the communication?<BR/><BR/>I can think of one concrete difference: the form of the content---Twitter is limited to 140 textual characters.</div>

cool. i think the goal mini-feed idea its important to keep the information useful for people that aren't necessarily working on the same project, but are "friends". <BR/><BR/>facebook's mini-feed is really cool because i see that my friend joe is using the KungFuKickingCazy facebook app a lot. then i get to wondering what is that crazy thing. it must be awesome cause joe found this other cool app last time we talked. <BR/><BR/>the mini-feed idea creates awareness of activities. it doesn't necessarily have to tell you the details of that activity. (but thats something we can fool around with). <BR/><BR/>the end goal for the mini-feed it to increase awareness of your friends activities and keep the community engaged. <BR/><BR/>now that is cool stuff.</div>
