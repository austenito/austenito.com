At a recent career fair, <a href="http://kagawaa.blogspot.com/">Aaron Kagawa</a> asked students the question,<br /><br />"<i>What is your favorite hotkey in Eclipse?</i>"<br /><br />Sadly, not very many students had an answer. &nbsp;<a href="http://djplazaro.blogspot.com/">Joel Lazaro</a>, a student&nbsp;in Dr. Philip Johnson's 414 class, is on the right track and posted a useful link on <a href="http://groups.google.com/group/uh-dorm-energy-competition-2010/browse_thread/thread/5a13ac6a7a299efa?pli=1">Eclipse shortcuts</a>.<br /><br />Being a productive developer means you trim the number of steps do your hacker tasks. &nbsp;Why is this important? &nbsp;Let's take a look at an extreme example, a daily task in Eclipse with and without hotkeys:<br /><br /><div style="margin-bottom: 0px; margin-left: 0px; margin-right: 0px; margin-top: 0px;"><b>A simple task with hotkeys</b></div><div style="margin-bottom: 0px; margin-left: 0px; margin-right: 0px; margin-top: 0px;"></div><div style="margin-bottom: 0px; margin-left: 0px; margin-right: 0px; margin-top: 0px;"></div><ol><li>Ctrl-Shift-T to open Foo Class</li><li>Ctrl-O to find and move to another method</li><li>Write some code</li><li>Ctrl-Shift-Up/Down to move to the next method</li><li>Ctrl-D to delete a line</li><li>Control-F11 to run the code</li></ol><div><b>Now the same task without Hotkeys</b></div><ol><li>Grab the mouse</li><li>Open the package navigator and search for the package where Foo Class exists</li><li>Double-click to open the Foo Class</li><li>Scroll with the mouse to find the method to edit</li><li>Write some code</li><li>Grab the mouse</li><li>Move to the next method</li><li>Using the mouse, highlight the entire line to delete</li><li>Move the mouse to the 'Run Application' Button</li><li>Run the code</li></ol>The main tasks to notice in the 'Without Hotkeys' example is the time spent searching and moving your hand to the mouse. &nbsp;When a developer skips out on the hotkeys, productivity suffers. &nbsp;Too much time is spent searching. &nbsp;When the file to edit is located, more time is spent searching for the place to edit. &nbsp;Once editing is done, it's back to the mouse to move someplace else. &nbsp;Rinse and repeat. &nbsp;*Yawn*<br /><b></b><br /><b><div><span class="Apple-style-span" style="font-weight: normal;">That isn't even the worst part. &nbsp;The worst part is the productivity of the entire team suffers. &nbsp;Less things get done because time is wasted. &nbsp;When other developers try to help, even more of their time evaporates. &nbsp;Let's take a&nbsp;</span><span class="Apple-style-span" style="font-weight: normal;"><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pair_programming">pair programming</a>&nbsp;example. &nbsp;I</span><span class="Apple-style-span" style="font-weight: normal;">t could be a formal session or an impromptu 'walk-by' to help someone out. &nbsp;The navigator stands their idling while the driver opens a class or finds a method using the mouse. &nbsp;Now the productivity of two people has flatlined. &nbsp;If you're the driver,&nbsp;<i>you're job is to drive fast</i>.&nbsp;</span></div><div><span class="Apple-style-span" style="font-weight: normal;"><br /></span></div><div><span class="Apple-style-span" style="font-weight: normal;">To better explain why hotkeys are so important, I'll reference the age-old analogy of a carpenter and his tools. &nbsp;Think of a carpenter's toolbelt. &nbsp;Pure genius right? It's inventor thought, "</span><i><span class="Apple-style-span" style="font-weight: normal;">I'll wrap a piece of leather around carpenter's waist so they can grab their tools quickly rather than waste their time going back to their tool box.</span></i><span class="Apple-style-span" style="font-weight: normal;">" &nbsp;Productivity went through the roof. &nbsp;Carpenters pick the right tool without moving or looking down. &nbsp;Commence carpenter <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flow_(psychology)">flow</a> time.</span></div></b><div style="margin-bottom: 0px; margin-left: 0px; margin-right: 0px; margin-top: 0px;"><br /></div><div style="margin-bottom: 0px; margin-left: 0px; margin-right: 0px; margin-top: 0px;">Hotkeys help developers to get "in the zone". &nbsp;When you stop to find a class or method, there are more opportunities to break your train of thought. &nbsp;Moving your hands off the keyboard and onto the mouse is like switching contexts. <a href="http://www.joelonsoftware.com/articles/fog0000000022.html">Switching tasks</a>&nbsp;is bad.</div><br />Are you ready to improve another skill in your toolset? &nbsp;Take a look at&nbsp;<a href="http://stackoverflow.com/questions/98220/what-is-your-favorite-hot-key-in-eclipse">Developers favorite Eclipse hotkeys</a>&nbsp;or hit Ctrl-Shift-L in Eclipse to list the available hot keys. &nbsp;If you use another IDE, take some time to learn about it's hotkeys, macros, and shortcuts.<br /><br />Still don't believe me? &nbsp;Think using the mouse is ok?<br /><br /><a href="http://steve-yegge.blogspot.com/2008/09/programmings-dirtiest-little-secret.html">Steve Yegge says, "Non-touch-typists have to make sacrifices in order to sustain their productivity"</a><br /><br />Death to the mouse!<br /><br /></div>

@Jason: Eclipse hotkeys are awesome.  I&#39;m checking out the eclipse mouse feed plugin now.</div>

Your post propelled me to learn more eclipse shortcuts, so I&#39;ve added quite a few more to my spaced repetition flash cards and that&#39;s been quite helpful.<br /><br />My search also brought me to the <a href="http://www.mousefeed.com/%22" rel="nofollow">MouseFeed eclipse plugin</a>. It shows you the equivalent shortcut everytime you do something with the mouse. I&#39;ve even put it in deny mode so it will cancel any actions I make with the mouse that could be done with the keyboard. It&#39;s been super helpful so far, especially with learning some of the refactoring shortcuts.</div>

Or you could just switch to Vim! But seriously in Vim, I wouldn&#39;t even consider the things shortcuts, they&#39;re just commands, you use them all the time.<br /><br />Of course Vim isn&#39;t the best for Java coding, I&#39;ve been meaning to check out <a href="http://eclim.org/" rel="nofollow">eclim</a> which looks pretty promising.</div>
