It's fall, so that means its time to switch to some heavier reds that pair well stews, chili, and roasted meats. An obvious pairing would be Syrah. So that's what we are tasting!

The goal of this tasting is a broad sampling of 100% Syrah wines in both classic and new styles from well known producers. Due to the premium price point of most Cote Rotie and Hermitage wines, I've selected a wine just outside of Cote Rotie with classic terrior and a baby 2011 Chave Farconnet.

## The Regions

* Cote Rotie - Translates to the "Roasted Slope" with some of the steepest vineyards in France. Wines are extremely elegant, dark colored, full bodied, spicy. The best have aromatic, floral finishes and flavors of black raspberry, black currant, violet and chocolate along with savory hints of olive, bacon fat, white pepper and powerful charcoal smoke.

* Saint Joseph - A large region on the west bank of the Rhone producing wines of different styles. Wines range in taste from spicy flavors of black olive and black pepper to richer, more complex wines similar to those found in Hermitage.

* Hermitage - A single continous vineyard broken up into lieu-dits. Wines are usually made from several lieu-dits. Produces the fullest bodied wines of the region with flavors of blackberry, black currant, licorice, coffee, candied cherry and smoke.

* Crozes-Hermitage - The largest wine producing region of the Rhone. Most of the vineyards are on the flat plains and style also varies here. Higher priced wines are hand-harvested on steeper vineyards. Wines are perfumed with notes of violet and fresh berries along with sharp acidity and tannin.

* Cornas - The southern most region in the Northern Rhone (tranlation warmest). Produces rustic wines with deep color, full bodied and in a style similar to Hermitage. Typically the boldest and most tannic of all the Northern Rhône with flavors of blackberry jam, black pepper, violet, charcoal, chalk dust and smoke followed up with grippy intense tannins.

## The Wines

* 2011 Syrah "Lézardes" VdP, Rostaing
* 2014 Crozes-Hermitage "Equinoxe", Graillot
* 2014 Crozes-Hermitage, Alain Graillot
* 2013 Crozes-Hermitage "Cuvée Albéric Bouvet," Gilles Robin
* 2014 St. Joseph, Dom. Faury
* 2011 Hermitage Rouge "Farconnet," J. L. Chave
* 2009 Cornas “Terre Brulée”, Domaine Lionnet

After tasting all of these wines, the big standout for me was how well structured Northern Rhone are. The tannins and acidity are in such balance and never step over each other. All of the wines had a lot of fruit, however they were never fruity or jammy. Pepper and spices were in every glass. The more complex wines had secondary notes of lavender, violets, and black olives.

Another interesting note was how prominent the green and herbaceous flavors were in wines fermenting with only partial destemming or full clusters. The aromas and flavors manifested themselves into green and and black currant notes.

Beef bourguignon was the food pairing and went absolutely perfect. Northern Rhone syrah turns out to be very food friendly with their medium plus acidity and elegant tannins.

The wine of the night was without a doubt, the 2011 Farconnet. Every sip brought new flavors and yet it's still a tiny baby. I can only imagine how it will open up in 10 years.
