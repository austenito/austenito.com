<p><font size="2"><font style="font-style: italic;" face="verdana">"Hashtags are a community-driven convention for adding additional context and metadata to your tweets. They're like tags on Flickr, only added inline to your post. You create a hashtag simply by prefixing a word with a hash symbol:</font> <em style="font-family: verdana; font-style: italic;">#hashtag</em></font><font style="font-style: italic;" face="verdana"><font size="2">." - http://twitter.pbwiki.com/Hashtags</font><br /><br /><br /></font><font face="verdana"><font size="1">This past week we spent working out the kinks of our in-house testing of openmbp's basic features like posting, following, favorites, account information. We've got a bug tracker up and soon it will be filled with tons of things to work on. With the in-house test continuing for a while, I'm turning my attention to post grouping.<br /><br /><br /><br />Twitter is going to role out groups sometime in the future and we are going to start working on getting grouping into openmbp. We are probably going to use hashtags to mark if a topic should be categorized.<br /></font></font></p><br /><br /></div>
