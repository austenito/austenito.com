Wow.  My last post was back in May.  It's been a while since I've made time for this blog thing, but it's been a good sabbatical. &nbsp;I'm reemerging on the interweb for the third time and hopefully here to stay. &nbsp;I want to stay committed and vigilant, as we all know how difficult it is to be an active blogger. &nbsp;My plan of posting twice a week turned into posting once a week, which then turned into not posting. &nbsp;Plan failure. &nbsp;But I have a new and improved plan!<br /><br />One day I had a 6 AM gym session with a friend. &nbsp;It changed my life. &nbsp;My schedule used to look like this:<br /><ul><li>9:00 AM &nbsp; Wake up</li><li>9:05 AM &nbsp; Go to Work</li><li>7:00 PM &nbsp; &nbsp;Read blogs, Side Project Work</li><li>10:00 PM &nbsp;Hit the Gym</li></ul><div>By the time I started working on my personal improvement tasks I would be tired and unfocused. I was amazed at how one morning gym session would make the rest of my day was incredible. &nbsp;I felt great. &nbsp;I didn't need to have 6 cups of coffee or some sugar to get through the day. &nbsp;My metabolism was in overdrive. &nbsp;I couldn't believe how awesome it was to start your day off with a workout.<br /></div><div><br /></div><div>So I changed my schedule:<br /></div><div><ul><li>5:45 AM &nbsp;Hit the Gym</li><li>7:45 AM &nbsp;Read blogs, Learn some cool stuff</li><li>7:00 PM &nbsp; Watch video blogs, listen to podcasts, take a break</li><li>10:30 PM Sleep</li></ul></div><div>Then one morning I found a blog that talked about&nbsp;<a href="http://www.getrichslowly.org/blog/2008/06/16/personal-finance-made-easy-pay-yourself-first/">Paying Yourself First</a>. &nbsp;What an excellent idea. &nbsp;I've always struggled with spending too much at the beginning of the month or when I get my paycheck. &nbsp;This is a great idea. &nbsp;Pay myself first. <br /></div><div><br /></div><div>Light Bulb.<br /></div><div><br /></div><div>My updated scheduled:<br /></div><div><div><ul><li>5:45 AM &nbsp;Hit the Gym</li><li><span style="color: red;">7:45 AM &nbsp;</span><b><span style="color: red;">Write a blog</span></b></li><li>7:00 PM &nbsp;&nbsp;Read blogs, Learn some cool stuff, Work on side projects,&nbsp;Watch video blogs, Listen to podcasts, Take a Break</li><li>10:30 PM Sleep</li></ul><div>So my new goal is to do some writing before I head to work. &nbsp;I don't have to write a complete blog or always try to finish existing blog. &nbsp;My goal is to <i>jot down my ideas</i>. &nbsp;If I can write down what I'm thinking about I should be able to get a blog out every week.<br /></div><div><br /></div><div>I honestly rather do my side project hacking in the morning when I'm the freshest, but I don't have enough time between my gym session and when I need to leave for the job. &nbsp;Once the tasking at work calms down a bit, I should be able to resume my Rails hacking.<br /></div></div></div><div><br /></div><div>A while ago I read an article by Sid Savara,&nbsp;<a href="http://sidsavara.com/personal-development/more-important-than-money-paying-myself-first-with-my-time">Paying Myself First With My Time</a>. &nbsp;I didn't buy into it then. &nbsp;How could I wake up early and start my day like that? &nbsp;Crazy Talk.<br /></div><div><br /></div><div>_Best Idea Ever_.<br /></div><br /><div><div><div><ul></ul><div><br /></div></div></div></div></div>

It&#39;s amazing when you experience that moment of discovering a way to focus more on personal goals and passions. Once you figure it out it will start to go smoothly. <br /><br />I am also trying to write a blog post once a week. Figuring out what to blog about has been tough. I like your idea of writing what I&#39;m thinking about. I&#39;m hoping if I put something out once a week it will eventually become a habit.</div>
