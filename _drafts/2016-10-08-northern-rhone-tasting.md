It's fall, so that means its time to switch to some heavier reds that pair well stews, chili, and roasted meats. An obvious pairing would be Syrah. So that's what we are tasting!

The goal of this tasting is a broad sampling of 100% Syrah wines in both classic and new styles from well known producers. Due to the premium price point of most Cote Rotie and Hermitage wines, I've selected a wine just outside of Cote Rotie with classic terrior and a baby 2011 Chave Farconnet.

Here's what we can expect from each region:

* Cote Rotie - Translates to the "Roasted Slope" with some of the steepest vineyards in France. Wines are extremely elegant, dark colored, full bodied, spicy. The best have aromatic, floral finishes and flavors of black raspberry, black currant, violet and chocolate along with savory hints of olive, bacon fat, white pepper and powerful charcoal smoke.

* Saint Joseph - A large region on the west bank of the Rhone producing wines of different styles. Wines range in taste from spicy flavors of black olive and black pepper to richer, more complex wines similar to those found in Hermitage.

* Hermitage - A single continous vineyard broken up into lieu-dits. Wines are usually made from several lieu-dits. Produces the fullest bodied wines of the region with flavors of blackberry, black currant, licorice, coffee, candied cherry and smoke.

* Crozes-Hermitage - The largest wine producing region of the Rhone. Most of the vineyards are on the flat plains and style also varies here. Higher priced wines are hand-harvested on steeper vineyards. Wines are perfumed with notes of violet and fresh berries along with sharp acidity and tannin.

* Cornas - The southern most region in the Northern Rhone (tranlation warmest). Produces rustic wines with deep color, full bodied and in a style similar to Hermitage. Typically the boldest and most tannic of all the Northern Rhône with flavors of blackberry jam, black pepper, violet, charcoal, chalk dust and smoke followed up with grippy intense tannins.


#### Syrah "Lézardes" VdP, Rostaing - 2011

> When, in the 1980s demand for grapes in Côte Rôtie surged, worries about overplanting led the INAO, in 1993, to pull in the appellation's boundaries. This deprived many former Côte Rôtie vineyards of the use of the name -- and, of course, drove down their value. René recognized the opportunity and began seaching for parcels outside the appellation with classic terroir. He acquired about two hectares in Lézardes, on the appellation's northern edge. Soon, Rostaing's Les Lézardes also had a cult following for its unmistakable Côte Rôtie nuance and character. - _GuildSomm_


#### Crozes-Hermitage "Equinoxe", Graillot - 2014

Completely destemmed. Alain's son


#### Crozes-Hermitage "Cuvée Albéric Bouvet," Gilles Robin - 2013

> The Robin wines are modern, clean, fruity expressions of Syrah grown on the Crozes plain. All grapes are hand-harvested. The grapes for “Albéric Bouvet” and “1920” are partially de-stemmed, depending on vintage, and the maceration lasts up to 30 days, with both pigeage and remontage daily. Aging is in barriques (about 20% new), and bottling is done with no filtration. - _GuildSomm_

#### Crozes-Hermitage, Alain Graillot - 2014

> The Graillot wines are a hybrid of the traditional and modern approaches in the region. They show ripe, concentrated and clean fruit, but only a maximum of 10% new oak is used in a vintage (most barrels are 228-liter barriques purchased used from friends in Burgundy). The red wines are made from whole clusters. - _GuildSomm_

#### St. Joseph, Dom. Faury - 2014

> Vines are located around the domaine, planted on steep slopes (up to 35%) facing south, south-east.
*  Hand harvested and 60 to 70% of grapes are de-stemmed
* Fermentation lasts 15 to 20 days
* Pump-overs occur twice daily
* Aged for 12 months in foudres (24 – 35 hl), demi-muids (600-L), barrels (228-L); only 10% new oak is used in the rotation of barrels

#### Hermitage Rouge "Farconnet," J. L. Chave - 2011

> Discover the JL Chave range by taking a much more accessible path to the heroic king of Hermitage through the Jean-Louis Chave Séléction – his négociant line which sources grapes from various areas in the northern Rhone. As with all things Chave, quality is eminent even at the entry level. Farconnet is the wine based on the younger vines of Domaine Chave that comes from three distinct parcels: Diognières, Péleat, and Greffieux. - http://www.shiverick.com/jean-louis-chave


#### Cornas “Terre Brulée”, Domaine Lionnet - 2009
