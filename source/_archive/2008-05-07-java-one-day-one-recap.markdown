[![][1] ][2] Registration!  Around the hotel and the convention center Sun put up conference flags.  It was kinda cool to walk around town looking for a place to eat and see the banners up.  Registration was extremely easy.  We entered our email address were given badges to wear around our next.  They include RFID chips that they use to scan us into sesssions that we registered for and also to randomly pick us for more swag.The cool thing is that this year they installed biometric sensors on all of the doors so they can track when people enter and exit.  They brought up some telemetry streams that show when the presentation would start and end.  What happens if there is a big spike of people leaving during the middle of the session?[![][3] ][4] After registration we headed to a huge conference hall with gigantic screens all over the place.  We were greeted with people dancing to hip hop.  Very weird.  I took some videos, which will go up on you tube a little bit later.James Gosling and his crew have a tradition of having a tshirt toss before they start talking.  A girl next to us got a shirt.  I hate her.The CEO of Sun came up to talk about the mantra of JavaOne this year, which is Java + You.  The motivation of the mantra is that software is no longer driven by enterprise needs.  It is driven by consumers, thus a lot of the sessions this year talk about RIAs with JavaFX, web applications with J* scripting languages, and user interfaces that help people improve their lives.[![][5] ][6] Next up was a huge session load.  Most of the sessions were really good.  The best one by far was the More Effective Java with Josh Bloch.  He highlighted new chapters in the 2nd edition of Effective Java.  I picked up a copy at the JavaOne bookstore and plan on sharing a tech talk.Sadly there was one session that was very boring with the presenters just reading off the slides and not adding any other information.  Lame.[![][7] ][8] Onto the best part, the swag!  Me and Mark walked around the pavilion area to get some cool gear and talk to people to see what's new out there in software land.  The first booth we hit was Atlassian's, where we scored shirts and 10% off new/upgrades of their tools.It was funny because we decided to hit each booth in order, but we ended up going towards the booths with the best swag.  The first picture of the collage shows Mark with all of the gear we got.  We had to make a pitstop at the hotel cause our shoulders were sore.The lesson for our company when we go to the con in Orlando is to bring good swag.  Pens and golf balls don't do it.The first day of Java One was pretty long.  I ended up getting back to the hotel around 11 after all of the sessions and eating dinner.
