People have a love/hate relationship with [Checkstyle][1] . &nbsp;Some people, myself included, are in the love camp. &nbsp;We include it in our development process. &nbsp;We strive for 0 checkstyle warnings. &nbsp;We fear committing Checkstyle warnings because of the ensuing shame resulting from&nbsp;[Hudson][2] &nbsp;unstable build emails. &nbsp;Other people tend to hate checkstyle. &nbsp;They think that checkstyle piles on work on the already piled on work stack. Here's why that's the wrong mindset to have.Checkstyle enforces your team's agreed upon code style guidelinesCode style is very religious subject. &nbsp;Very Religious. &nbsp;It creates just as many holy wars as the "My IDE is better than yours" argument. &nbsp;But I think everyone can agree that having code style guidelines is a good thing. &nbsp;It aids teams by keeping code uniform and easy to read. &nbsp;Reading code is hard enough without having to weed through 20 different ways types of if-statements and for-loops.This one is easy. &nbsp;You have style guidelines, let's make sure that everyone is following them. &nbsp;It doesn't take much work to integrate Checkstyle into the daily build. &nbsp;Enforcing code style is a good thing. &nbsp;It really doesn't matter what the style is. &nbsp;What matters is that everyone follows what rules the team has agreed upon.Checkstyle forces you to write documentationDevelopers hate writing documentation. &nbsp;If you love writing code comments then you are a sick, sick person and you probably already love Checkstyle. &nbsp;Feel free to stop reading. &nbsp;Now for the rest of us, we often have a personal two-way connection to our source. &nbsp;We know what it does. &nbsp;At least we know what it does right now. &nbsp;What about two weeks from now? &nbsp;One month? &nbsp;One year?Integrating Checkstyle into your development process forces you to stop and think. &nbsp;It makes you question what your code does. &nbsp;It can help validate your design. &nbsp;Often times I find myself asking questions like:> > > > > The intricacies of your code exist in your head at this very moment. &nbsp;Why not write it down? &nbsp;Checkstyle makes it so.The argument against forcing developers to write documentation is that they will write useless comments. &nbsp;This isn't a fault of Checkstyle, it's a fault of the developer. &nbsp;Why aren't they writing good documentation? &nbsp;Why aren't other developers getting on the bad documenter's case? &nbsp;Is anyone else reviewing their code to make sure they aren't being sloppy? &nbsp;Checkstyle doesn't do any of that. &nbsp;Your team does.Checkstyle isn't for you, it's for everyone elseI believe we all can agree that clear, concise, and well documented code helps other developers. &nbsp;There is &nbsp;a feeling of pure joy when you use a well-documented third party library. &nbsp;Since all code you write will be used by other developers, shouldn't you impose the same documentation standards on yourself that you wish everyone else would follow? What about the argument of "Why should I care about checkstyle? &nbsp;I know how to document". &nbsp;Even if it were true that you always wrote great documentation, 99.9% of us aren't like you. &nbsp;We need help verifying that we are indeed following code style standards. &nbsp;Checkstyle keeps us honest. &nbsp;After all, we are developers and developers are lazy. &nbsp;Sometimes we need a little prodding to keep ourselves disciplined.Checkstyle is just a tool. &nbsp;If you don't use the tool correctly, then of course it's going to suck. &nbsp;Used in the right way it's extremely powerful, even for something as seemingly trivial as code style.

Checkstyle is a game.  Once you figure out the rules, it&#39;s pretty easy to play.In a perfect world, we wouldn&#39;t need Checkstyle.  Everyone would write awesome documentation and follow the style guidelines.Too bad we don&#39;t live in a perfect world.  And that&#39;s not a bad thing.  It&#39;s okay to have tools help us.  It let&#39;s us think about more important things like what food place to eat next ;)I really don&#39;t know what to say if people don&#39;t stop being crappy.  Good developers should know better.  No one is perfect, but once the area of weakness is pointed out, they go ahead and fix the problem.  If it happens repeatedly, I don&#39;t know if it&#39;s laziness, lack of self-discipline, no attention to detail, or they simple don&#39;t care.  Something is wrong if they don&#39;t realize that they aren&#39;t helping others and are wasting everyones time.  If a team comes up with a set of rules, why would you ignore them?

I&#39;ve never thought it was that much work because if you know what will fail Checkstyle you have the option of not doing it in the first place.  Obviously I am one of those people who love it.However, I have learned that while it makes things better, people who are determined not to change will still end up writing horribly styled code that still somehow manages to pass Checkstyle.  I hate that we&#39;ve pretty much been forced to take on the &quot;wrong mindset&quot; because some people don&#39;t care and won&#39;t just do something on their own.  So we have to try and force them and then end up with something crappy, which I don&#39;t know if that is better than nothing.For the life of me I cannot understand why people can&#39;t just follow the style of code that everyone else is using.  It is bad that we have reviews and the first 75% of the comments is about erroneous whitespace or something.
