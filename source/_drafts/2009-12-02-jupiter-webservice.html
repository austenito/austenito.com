I was thinking that we could use Jupiter's eclipse front end to talk to a Ruby webservice.<br /><br />Setting up a review:<br />1. Configure the review using the jupiter UI.<br />2. Select members to participate in the review.<br />3. Publish review information to the webservice.<br /><br />Loading a review:<br />1. Register yourself with the web service if you haven't done so.<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;- username, email, picture?<br />2. Webservice will publish to you the reviews that you are part of.<br />3. Conduct review.<br />4. Publish results.<br /><br />Going through the review:<br />1. Pull changes from the webservice.<br />2. Go through the moderated code review.<br />3. Publish changes.<br /><br />The author can then edit the changes and publish information back to the web service.<br /><br />Work to be done:<br /><br />1. Webservice<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;Webservice configuration. &nbsp;URL, admin password, etc. &nbsp;No web interface for the beginning stages.<br />2. UI Updates.<br /><br /><br /><br /><div style="margin-bottom: 0px; margin-left: 0px; margin-right: 0px; margin-top: 0px;">At the CSDL (link it) we used an in-house product called Jupiter. &nbsp;My friend Julie(link her blog) provides the maintenance of the tool with each new release of Eclipse. &nbsp;She does a great job. &nbsp;Jupiter's code review functionality can't be beat. &nbsp;With Jupiter you can review code in your Eclipse IDE. &nbsp;You get to use all of the IDE functionality that you are used to with some special Jupiter review sauce. &nbsp;The huge draw back of Jupiter is that it takes a really long time to setup the review because you have to create the review in eclipse and then send out an email to your developers saying what to review. &nbsp;Then you need to commit a .jupiter file, which is a pain in the butt. &nbsp;You also have to make sure that the .jupiter file resides in a branch because you don't want that file to live in your trunk source. &nbsp;Then you have to make sure you do a code freeze because you don't want people reviewing a different change set. &nbsp;You could specify which revisions to review, but then the developers have to switch to the correct revision. &nbsp;As you start to get lots of developers commiting their changes you'll notice that the review process of Jupiter just doesn't scale.<br /></div><div style="margin-bottom: 0px; margin-left: 0px; margin-right: 0px; margin-top: 0px;"><br /></div><div style="margin-bottom: 0px; margin-left: 0px; margin-right: 0px; margin-top: 0px;">(Talk to Julie about improving the review process? &nbsp;A Jupiter server. &nbsp;Webapp that allows you to link up reviews and see what is going on?)<br /></div></div>
