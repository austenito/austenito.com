<div class='post'>
So I'm doing a huge redesign at work.  We have been tasked to move some legac code over to a brand new architecture. We have to keep a bunch of things in perspective:  We don't have much time We want to reuse as mch code as possible We don't want to break existing functionality  Software is hard.    I'm looking at my code trying to figure ot what I can reuse what makes sense and what doesn't. There is a lo of code. And man does it suck. I don't even understand why I made half of the designs I made.  what I thought would we reusable turned out to be completely unrobist. What I thought was useful and stable turned out to be extremely brittle with one little change.  and all if this is a good thing.  Im a tually not discouraged at all by what I'm seeing. Yes it sucks that I wrote and now have to maintain tons of crappy code. But had I not improved since the time I wrote the code I would have been extremely disappointed.    It's funny how I've found critical design designs not to really mater in the long run.    Somethings I did good:   I picked a design and went with it.  It might not be the best design or implementation, but I got things done. I wanted to be a doer becUse I learned things on the way.    What I'm afraid of:  moving past the line of some design and doing to over design.  I don't think could have ever planned for a lot of things that has happened.  And that's ok. I'm learning on the way.   Code reuse is king.   Testing dots and value objects is dumb Mock objects rule Managing unit tests suck when they are different packages Desktops > laptops Trusting your coworkers is key Getting things done is better than getting things right Alot of code is never reused anyways so don't spend too much time designing Threads are hard</div>
