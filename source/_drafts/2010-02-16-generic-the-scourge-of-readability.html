I have a feeling that one day someone is going to update Effective Java with a new item that says:<br /><br />"Use Generic Judiciously"<br /><br />First of all you should understand that I'm a dynamic language fan boy. &nbsp;I love ducktyping. &nbsp;After all if it looks like a duck and acts like a duck, then by all means it should quack like a duck. &nbsp;I love languages that are clear and concise and don't require my brain to jump into hyper drive (space balls reference) to have some resemblence of understanding.<br /><br />So that brings me to Java's generics. <br /><br />I think it's a useful feature. &nbsp;A really big hack (look this up), but a useful feature when used correctly. &nbsp;Hashmap and list are good examples of generics used correctly. <br /><br />[example]<br /><br />It's clear what the generics are typing. <br /><br />Here is a bad example.<br /><br />[example] &nbsp;Aggregator<br /><br />Someone please tell why it's so easy to abuse generics and make it so hard to figure what is going on. &nbsp;Is this really worth the type safety?</div>
