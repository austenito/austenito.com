<p style="clear: both">Tv Budget</p><p style="clear: both">I watch too much tv. Here is the list of shows that I watch:</p><p style="clear: both">How I Met Your Mother - 30 mins/week<br />The Big Bang Theory - 30 mins/week<br />House - 1 hour/week<br />Lost - 1 hour/week<br />Misc JDrama - 1 hour each episode, but I normally watch a bunch a week. So I'll say 4 hours/week<br />Baseball Tonight - 30 minutes/week<br />American Idol - 1 hour/week<br />Anime - 1 hour/week </p><p style="clear: both">That's 9.5 hours/week. Sometimes I don't watch certain shows, so I could average this out and say I watch 6 hours a week of television. That's alot. Thats 494 hours/year I could spend on hacking on side projects, reading books, or other self-improvement projects.</p><p style="clear: both">Like money management, there are certain things I can live without. I don't need to watch certain types of show or if I do, it's to treat myself every now and then. Here is my revised tv budget:</p><p style="clear: both">How I Met Your Mother - 30 mins/week<br />The Big Bang Theory - 30 mins/week<br />Lost - 1 hour/week<br />Misc JDrama - 1 hour/week<br />Baseball Tonight - 30 minutes/week<br />Anime - 30 mins/week</p><p style="clear: both">That's 4 hours/week, 208 hours a year watching television. That's 286 less hours doing nothing. 286 hours that I can spend doing something productive.</p><p style="clear: both">Definetly an improvement.</p><p style="clear: both"></p><br class='final-break' style='clear: both' /></div>
