So I'm running through my Omnifocus (link it up) list of "Things to Read" that I've saved through out the week and I come across this article by Martin Fowler, &nbsp;on Continous Integration. &nbsp;http://martinfowler.com/articles/continuousIntegration.html &nbsp;. &nbsp;The article was originally written in the year 2000. &nbsp;Ten years ago. &nbsp;I was only a junior in high school at the time. &nbsp;I find it crazy that there needs to be an article on continious integration. <br /><br />This line is crazy to me. &nbsp;"I begin by taking a copy of the current integrated source onto my local development machine. I do this by using a source code management system by checking out a working copy from the mainline.<br />The above paragraph will make sense to people who use source code control systems, but be gibberish to those who don't.&nbsp;" &nbsp;Software development really is a baby. &nbsp;Just 10 years ago, people might not have known what version control system was. &nbsp;Right now it's common place to have a centralized source control system like Subversion or a distribution system like Git or Mercurial. &nbsp;Checking out the latest source code daily, running automated unit tests and daily check ins were novel ideas back then. &nbsp;That's amazing!<br /><br />I can't imagine my life without all these things. &nbsp;It's common place now. &nbsp;Everyone knows the benefits, or at least they should if they are a self-respecting developer.<br /><br />That makes me wonder what the software development landscape is going to look like in 10 years. &nbsp;I see a shift where the language barrier is being broken. &nbsp;Different languages talking to each are common place. &nbsp;We have things like JRuby, Jython, and other languages that take advantage of the JVM. &nbsp;We have protocol buffers. &nbsp;We have Active MQ. &nbsp;In 10 years is it going to even matter that we choose a particular language for a specific benefit like performance or language feature? &nbsp;What new ideas will be relevant 10 years from now just like how continuous integration, automated tests, and version control systems are be common place now. &nbsp;What are the new, revolutionary ideas now?<br /><br />do some research on this? &nbsp;What is crazy now? <br /><br /><br /></div>
