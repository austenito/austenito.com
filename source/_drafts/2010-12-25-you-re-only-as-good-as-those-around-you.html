The other night while out with some friends, someone brought up the idea that a baseball player in high school wasn't really all that good at his school even though he was a highly touted prospect at another school.  the other school's baseball team wasn't all that good so in their eyes,  the player was a stud. Not so much at my friends high school.<br /><br />It's funny how random topics translate into something related in software.<br /><br />We really are only as good as those surrounding us.<br /><br />It's nice being the big fish in the small pond.<br /><br />It's nice when people ask you for help.<br /><br />But are you really a stud?<br /><br />But how do you improve?  Who do you ask for help?  Are you really good at what you do?<br /><br />I've been thinking about this a lot lately.  I played baseball for Damien.  We aren't really all that good and I was a starter.  A decent enough player.  But would I start on the big boy schools?  Definitely not.  Was my growth stunted due to my surrounding team?  Probably.<br /><br />how do I fix this?<br /><br />how can I seriously improve where I am and where I'm going?  maybe it's time to figure out a 5 year goal.  Maybe I can work towards playing for the big boys.  <br /><br />I probably need to set up some sort of plan.<br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /></div>
