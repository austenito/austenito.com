<div><div><div style="margin-bottom: 0px; margin-left: 0px; margin-right: 0px; margin-top: 0px;">What I've been lacking in studying and preparing is that I've been thinking about things. I've started reading financial planning blogs. I've taken an interest in learning about different countries and wine. I'm listening to different types of music. I'm saving for things that I want to do in the future. I'm browsing the web smarter. I've changed my lifestyle. I used to believe that the only way to become awesome was to constantly live in the software world. Read software blogs. Hack on software all the time. Talk about software. This year I'm starting to realize that maybe that isn't the best way to improve myself. Am I going to turn into a one trick pony? What about my soft-skills? So it's time to rebalance my life portfolio.&nbsp; What's important? Where do I want to go? How do I get there?<br /></div></div><div><div style="margin-bottom: 0px; margin-left: 0px; margin-right: 0px; margin-top: 0px;"><br /></div></div><div><div style="margin-bottom: 0px; margin-left: 0px; margin-right: 0px; margin-top: 0px;"><br /></div></div><div><div style="margin-bottom: 0px; margin-left: 0px; margin-right: 0px; margin-top: 0px;">My new goal is now to pay myself first. I'm talking about what Sid talks about. Hacking, blogging, reading blogs, learning.<br /></div></div><div><div style="margin-bottom: 0px; margin-left: 0px; margin-right: 0px; margin-top: 0px;"><br /></div></div></div><div></div></div>
