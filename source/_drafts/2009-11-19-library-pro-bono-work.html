<div style="margin-bottom: 0px; margin-left: 0px; margin-right: 0px; margin-top: 0px;">I had no idea that some of the branches close at 8 PM. &nbsp;That's a reasonable time for people to go to the library after work. &nbsp;The later hours is definately convinient for me.<br /></div><div style="margin-bottom: 0px; margin-left: 0px; margin-right: 0px; margin-top: 0px;">I came across a website when I was using stumpleupon called&nbsp;<a href="http://bookmooch.com/">Book Mooch</a>.&nbsp; It's an online book trading website where people mail each other books that they want to read.<br /></div><div style="margin-bottom: 0px; margin-left: 0px; margin-right: 0px; margin-top: 0px;"><br /></div><div style="margin-bottom: 0px; margin-left: 0px; margin-right: 0px; margin-top: 0px;">What a cool idea!<br /></div><div style="margin-bottom: 0px; margin-left: 0px; margin-right: 0px; margin-top: 0px;"><br /></div><div style="margin-bottom: 0px; margin-left: 0px; margin-right: 0px; margin-top: 0px;">I wouldn't want to share my address with anyone so I might get post office box.<br /></div><div style="margin-bottom: 0px; margin-left: 0px; margin-right: 0px; margin-top: 0px;"><br /></div><div style="margin-bottom: 0px; margin-left: 0px; margin-right: 0px; margin-top: 0px;">Using this service might have its drawbacks because we are Living in Hawaii. &nbsp;I'd imagine this service would work better if you could trade books with people by meeting at a local library or shopping center. &nbsp;You could meet up at the library with name tags for a quick book swap. &nbsp;You could see what are the books that are being traded the most.<br /></div><div style="margin-bottom: 0px; margin-left: 0px; margin-right: 0px; margin-top: 0px;"><br /></div><div style="margin-bottom: 0px; margin-left: 0px; margin-right: 0px; margin-top: 0px;">I searched around on Book Mooch and there is a listing for Honolulu! &nbsp;I'm excited. &nbsp;I'm still worried about the whole sharing my address deal.<br /></div><div style="margin-bottom: 0px; margin-left: 0px; margin-right: 0px; margin-top: 0px;"><br /></div><div style="margin-bottom: 0px; margin-left: 0px; margin-right: 0px; margin-top: 0px;"><span style="-webkit-border-horizontal-spacing: 2px; -webkit-border-vertical-spacing: 2px; font-family: arial, sans-serif;"><i><b>(where people should send books to you, only revealed to people you've asked for books. Include your name, street address, city, state (if applicable) and postal code, but not your country.)</b></i></span><br /></div><div style="margin-bottom: 0px; margin-left: 0px; margin-right: 0px; margin-top: 0px;"><br /></div><div style="margin-bottom: 0px; margin-left: 0px; margin-right: 0px; margin-top: 0px;">Scary. &nbsp;I like the internet, but I don't like giving strangers my address. &nbsp;I think there is a difference between giving a business your address and giving a stranger on a social website your address. &nbsp;I don't think I'll use this service, but it is definitely a great idea.<br /></div><div style="margin-bottom: 0px; margin-left: 0px; margin-right: 0px; margin-top: 0px;"><br /></div><div style="margin-bottom: 0px; margin-left: 0px; margin-right: 0px; margin-top: 0px;">I wish the library would do these kinds of things. &nbsp;Right now we can reserve books online and have them get shipped to you nearest branch. &nbsp;But we can't renew books online, we have to call them. &nbsp;Why is that? &nbsp;Why is the library system so behind the times? &nbsp;Is it because they don't get very much funding?<br /></div><div style="margin-bottom: 0px; margin-left: 0px; margin-right: 0px; margin-top: 0px;"><br /></div><div style="margin-bottom: 0px; margin-left: 0px; margin-right: 0px; margin-top: 0px;">What is college students could work on these types of projects for credit? &nbsp;There are so many projects that could be done to help the community and also greatly benefit are up and coming hackers. &nbsp;Organization of all of this would be a huge deal.<br /></div></div>
