I have been spending a a lot of time rebalancing my financial portfolio over the past couple months. &nbsp;I've been thinking about what is my level of risk?<br /><br />I came across and interesting article yesterday called&nbsp;<a href="http://the99percent.com/tips/6103/the-40-30-30-rule-why-risk-is-worth-it">40-30-30 Rule: Why Risk Is Worth It</a>. &nbsp;This article talks how learning new skills is 40% physical, 30% skills related, and 30% of taking <b>risks</b>.<br /><br />It's kind of interesting how taking risks are a part of life. &nbsp;People say that you should be taking risks in your financial portfolio and in life experiences when you are young because you have less to lose. &nbsp;You don't have a home, spouse, kids, resposibilities. &nbsp;Once you get any number of those things your tolerance for risk goes way down.<br /><br />What about taking risks in your career? &nbsp;Learning new things in the computer science field is a must. &nbsp;I try take risks by trying to learn new languages (currently Ruby and Rails), reading a bunch of technical blogs and books, and focusing on improving my technique at work. &nbsp;The 40-30-40 article talks about playing a game by always using the same strategy. &nbsp;You don't really grow when you keep using the same strategies or you might not be able to find a better strategy. &nbsp;This past year I've been focusing on trying to keep an open mind and listening to what other developers have to say. &nbsp;This works out really well because I get to see other developers perspectives on the problem. &nbsp;After all, people are smart, and they often see things in a different light.<br /><br />I was reading taking financial risks (link to how much risk you should take) and started thinking about other types of risk. &nbsp;What types of risks do I take in my life?<br /><br />http://www.livestrong.com/article/14727-becoming-a-risk-taker/<br /><br /><span class="Apple-style-span" style="color: #515151; font-family: Arial, Helvetica; font-size: 13px; line-height: 18px;">Deciding to make a personal sacrifice of time, energy, ability and knowledge as an investment to better your circumstances.</span><br /><span style="color: #515151; font-family: Arial, Helvetica; font-size: small;"><span class="Apple-style-span" style="font-size: 13px; line-height: 18px;">The willingness to accept honest, objective feedback about the need for you to change your own behavior.</span></span><br /><span style="color: #515151; font-family: Arial, Helvetica; font-size: small;"><span class="Apple-style-span" style="font-size: 13px; line-height: 18px;"><br /></span></span><br />http://www.powerhomebiz.com/vol47/risk.htm<br /><br />The comfort zone<br /><br />The fear of taking risks<br /><br />Risk Assesment<br />The rewards of taking risks<br /><br />What happens if you don't take risks?<br /><br /><br /><br /><div style="margin-bottom: 0px; margin-left: 0px; margin-right: 0px; margin-top: 0px;"><br /></div><div style="margin-bottom: 0px; margin-left: 0px; margin-right: 0px; margin-top: 0px;">I've been thinking Lot lately about what I'm really doing with my life. Am I saving enough. Am I experiencing enough. Do I need to travel more? Do I need to try new places to eat? Am I meeting enough new people? Am I learning enough?</div><div style="margin-bottom: 0px; margin-left: 0px; margin-right: 0px; margin-top: 0px;"><br /></div><div style="margin-bottom: 0px; margin-left: 0px; margin-right: 0px; margin-top: 0px;">Everything is overwhelming me. Today I was listening tothe passive incredibly podcast and it talked about goals that are SMART.</div><div style="margin-bottom: 0px; margin-left: 0px; margin-right: 0px; margin-top: 0px;"><br /></div><div style="margin-bottom: 0px; margin-left: 0px; margin-right: 0px; margin-top: 0px;"><br /></div><div style="margin-bottom: 0px; margin-left: 0px; margin-right: 0px; margin-top: 0px;">Specific</div><div style="margin-bottom: 0px; margin-left: 0px; margin-right: 0px; margin-top: 0px;"><br /></div><div style="margin-bottom: 0px; margin-left: 0px; margin-right: 0px; margin-top: 0px;">Measurable</div><div style="margin-bottom: 0px; margin-left: 0px; margin-right: 0px; margin-top: 0px;"><br /></div><div style="margin-bottom: 0px; margin-left: 0px; margin-right: 0px; margin-top: 0px;">Attainable</div><div style="margin-bottom: 0px; margin-left: 0px; margin-right: 0px; margin-top: 0px;"><br /></div><div style="margin-bottom: 0px; margin-left: 0px; margin-right: 0px; margin-top: 0px;">Realistic</div><div style="margin-bottom: 0px; margin-left: 0px; margin-right: 0px; margin-top: 0px;"><br /></div><div style="margin-bottom: 0px; margin-left: 0px; margin-right: 0px; margin-top: 0px;">Timely</div><div style="margin-bottom: 0px; margin-left: 0px; margin-right: 0px; margin-top: 0px;"><br /></div><div style="margin-bottom: 0px; margin-left: 0px; margin-right: 0px; margin-top: 0px;">when I think about it, I really haven't thought about my goals smartly. I have a couple of goals, become an awesome coder, get to the technical lead level, release something.</div><div style="margin-bottom: 0px; margin-left: 0px; margin-right: 0px; margin-top: 0px;"><br /></div><div style="margin-bottom: 0px; margin-left: 0px; margin-right: 0px; margin-top: 0px;">How can I do this smartly?</div><div style="margin-bottom: 0px; margin-left: 0px; margin-right: 0px; margin-top: 0px;"><br /></div><div style="margin-bottom: 0px; margin-left: 0px; margin-right: 0px; margin-top: 0px;">My financial life is on track im keeping stats on how im doing each month and where i need to go.</div><div style="margin-bottom: 0px; margin-left: 0px; margin-right: 0px; margin-top: 0px;"><br /></div><div style="margin-bottom: 0px; margin-left: 0px; margin-right: 0px; margin-top: 0px;">Why dont i do this with my career? For one thing it's really hard to measure my current goals. And since it's hard to measure, it's hard to achieve them in a timely manner.</div><div style="margin-bottom: 0px; margin-left: 0px; margin-right: 0px; margin-top: 0px;"><br /></div><div style="margin-bottom: 0px; margin-left: 0px; margin-right: 0px; margin-top: 0px;">Something I really want to do is work for a mainland company. How do I do that? How do I get there? I guess I could make that more specific. I want to work in Washigton. The measurable part doesn't really apply. I guess I need to just do it. Attainable? Defiantly. Realistic? Yes! But how would I organize something g like that? How much would it cost to move, to live, to ship my stuff? Timely? I want to do it soon. Let's shoot for the middle of next year.</div><div style="margin-bottom: 0px; margin-left: 0px; margin-right: 0px; margin-top: 0px;"><br /></div><div style="margin-bottom: 0px; margin-left: 0px; margin-right: 0px; margin-top: 0px;">releasing something: failed because I picked something that wasn't really attainable.</div><div style="margin-bottom: 0px; margin-left: 0px; margin-right: 0px; margin-top: 0px;"><br /></div><div style="margin-bottom: 0px; margin-left: 0px; margin-right: 0px; margin-top: 0px;"><br /></div><div style="margin-bottom: 0px; margin-left: 0px; margin-right: 0px; margin-top: 0px;">talk about taking risks. I need to take more risks now while I can.</div><div style="margin-bottom: 0px; margin-left: 0px; margin-right: 0px; margin-top: 0px;">How expensive are these risks? will I know the answers? Probably not but I shouldn't ace. Sometimes you just need to do it.</div></div>
