I love writing these "State of the Union" blog posts. It's always fun to take a 
look at what I was feeling during a different point in my life. 

# 2011 End of the Year Update

So let's recap on what did in 2011.

* Run through [Writing your first Django app][1]

Nope didn't do this.

* Write 18 blog posts and improve my online presence

Negative.

* Save $5000 by the end of 2011

Accomplished!

* Complete the marathon

Accomplished!

* Skydiving

I didn't do this on my birthday, however I accomplished this in 2012!

* Average 7 hours a week about something I'm passionate about

This was a funny goal now thinking about what happened in 2012. The majority of 
my time was spent focusing on the Hawaii tech scene and building up
[HI Capacity][2]. 7 hours a week huh? 364 hours of working on something I'm
passionate about. I think I hit that goal before the middle of the year. Doing 
things like:

* Working with The Box Jelly to get HI Capacity a physical space
* Participating in Node Knockout
* Participating in Startup Weekend
* Organzing meetups and nerdy things

# What happened in 2012

And then there was 2012. What. a. year.

2012 was about firsts. The craziest thing was buying a one way ticket to 
Washington D.C. for [Hungry Acadmey][3]. It was 5 months of intensive Ruby and Rails
training. I learned so much and pushed my self so hard. It was such an amazing
and life changing experience. My work there enabled me to be hired as a web
developer at LivingSocial. 

Living in a completely different city changed my outlook on how I live now.
Having a car isn't the best thing in the world. Driving is terrible. Walking to 
work, riding a train (which is where I'm writing this blog), hopping on a metro
is the best way to travel. I love being in an urban environment. My trip to 
New York City was amazing! I'm going to live there.

Among other things I did, here's the random breakdown:

* Rode a train for the first time
* Sky diving
* Moved into a terrible smelling apartment, then upgraded to an great place
  in walking distance to work.
* Went to a ton of baseball games including games 4 and 5 of the NLDS where I 
witnessed a walk-off home run and a crushing collapse.
* Tubing in a river!
* Attended a Code Retreat in Floyd, Virginia.
* Visted Quinn and Sue in Lusby, Maryland in a Mini Cooper (Go ZipCar!)
* Experienced my first white Christmas in Baltimore. Snowball fight included.

# What's coming up in 2013?

As the years go by as a developer, I find myself focusing less on
software and more on my life. There are things I want to do this
year besides hack on all the things. And while I'm still hacking on all the things, 
I don't want it to compeletely take over my life.

I had an interesting conversation with my roommate the other day. We talked
about the movie Looper. (Spoiler Alert) In the movie there is a point where 
the "loop is closed" on a looper. Basically you know you're going to die
in 30 years. What would do if you knew the exact date when you would die? I'm sure
you would live your life completely different. What's odd is when you think 
about it, we know with an approximation of when we're going to die. In the best
case we'll live till we're 80. In the worst case, the next minute or so might
not be so good. If I know with a reasonable expection when the end is
coming, why don't I live like I'm going to die young? (Yes Kesha is great)

So what am I doing this year? How am I going to push myself to be proud of the
way I spend my days. 

I'm going to be 30 in 2013. Here's a list of 20 things I want do:

1. Eat at Sushi Taro
2. Smithsonian Aerospace Museum
3. NFL Game
4. NHL Game
5. NBA game
6. MLS game
7. Black Friday Shopping
8. Trout fly fishing
9. Camping in the mountains
10. Watch the fireworks on the Mall
11. Snowboading
12. Visit the National Zoo
13. Visit the Newseum
14. FRENCH LAUNDRY OMG
15. Add physical photos and cards to an album
16. Read 3 wine books
17. Flavor Profiling
18. Eat at Ray's Hell Burger
19. Participate in an introductory online French course
20. Watch a baseball game at Fenway. 

Over the course of the year I'm going to complete these activities. I'm to trading
my days for something I've never experienced before.

Now onto my technical goals. That's a little bit harder. I never thought I
would say that.

Here's what I want to do. 

* Re-write [Playlistdio][4] with Rails and a relational database.
* Finish a super secret game clone.
* Contribute to an open source library.
* Go to DC tech meetups
* Volunteer at CodeNow
* Compete in hackathons!

Onward into 2013!
