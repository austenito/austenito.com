[Software by Rob][1]  posted a link titled: [100 Resources to Attract, Retain, and Use Rockstar Programmers][2] .  One-third of the links are job boards, but below those are some interesting articles about how people in the industry choose their developers.  I read two articles that caught my eye, [The Engineering Value of Blogging][3]  and [Hire Programmers From Open Source][4] .I've talked to some developers that do not see the value of blogging, but I do feel that being able to write your software thoughts, troubles, and experiences down really helps me get a clear idea of what I'm doing.  You can think of blogging as doing your software design on paper.  You don't just sit in front of your workstation and start whipping out code.  You slow down, grab some paper, and draw out how you are going to solve problems x, y, and z.  When you blog,  it helps you stop and think about what has happened.  You can reflect on a interesting blog you found or bring up technical problems in your current open-source project.Both blogging and open source software are techniques to improve yourself as a developer.  Well-known software bloggers often write about making yourself marketable because you never know when you will need to look for another job.  Who knows what could happen.  Maybe your employer is running through tough times or you just don't like what you are doing.  Making yourself marketable doesn't happen overnight.  It will take many years of hardwork, discipline and motivation.  As a noob developer, I'm still starting on this process.  It is tough staying disciplined, but I know that it will be worth it.Give people all the information about what type of software developer you are.  Help interviewers out.  They are the ones that need to figure out if you are right for their company.   Blogging and Open Source contributions give them that information.  Type your name into Google.  I know your interviewer will.
