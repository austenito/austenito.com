I've been slacking on the blogging and the reading so to get motivated I'm posting a book queue.

1. [Clean Code: A Handbook of Agile Software Craftsmanship (Robert C. Martin Series)][1]    
2. [Outliers: The Story of Success][2]  (Finish reading it.)   
3. [Design Patterns: Elements of Reusable Object-Oriented Software (Addison-Wesley Professional Computing Series)][3]    
4. [House of Leaves][4] 
5. [Mentoring: The Tao of Giving and Receiving Wisdom][5]    
6. [The Bro Code][6] 

My goal is to get back to reading a book a month. I've read the GoF book already, but it's time to refresh 
my design patterns. I read it over 3 years ago, so I will probably have a new understanding of when/where 
to use certain patterns.

I've also changed my reading to include fun and non-technical books. Hopefully that will keep me reading. 
I've noticed that it's a drag to read technical books all the time. The books are interesting, but my mind 
needs something new every now and then.
