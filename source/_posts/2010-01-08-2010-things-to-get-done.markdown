In the spirit of new years I decided to do what everyone else is doing, create a list of things I want to accomplish this year, i.e., my New Year's Resolution. &nbsp;I remember I created a [List of Things I Want to Do][1]  way back in 2008. &nbsp;Let's see how I matched up 2 years later:
- Improve my writing skills 
- Ruby/Apache Wicket and Hackystat 
- Practice Puzzles 
- Play with Python 
- Give a speech to a group about something technology

The things I didn't complete are in red. &nbsp;How sad. &nbsp;Two years later I still haven't tried out Python. &nbsp;I think I have improved my writing skills a bit, but I had a blog hiatus in 2009. &nbsp;Hopefully we will miss that episode this year. &nbsp;I tried implementing a Hackystat UI using Ruby on Rails in 2008. &nbsp;Other than mentoring a student for Google Summer of Code 2009, I haven't done any new work on Hackystat. &nbsp;The [Collaborative Software Development Laboratory][2]  has started new work in the smart grid energy field. &nbsp;It's an interesting area with mounds of real-world application potential. &nbsp;I'm excited to see the direction they take their research. &nbsp;Perhaps I might find an opportunity to contribute to their work.

I didn't create a list of things to get done in 2009, but I did have a [Periodic Resume Update][3] &nbsp;that talks about what I've done and where I'm headed. &nbsp;It seems that I believed that Openmbp was the direction I was headed in 2009. &nbsp;That idea has passed and now it's onto new things.

&nbsp;I'm a year older and starting to think about new things. In the past two years I was concerned with everything technology related. &nbsp;I wanted to improve my hacking skills and learn new technologies. &nbsp;Learning new technical skills is important, but I now believe that other aspects of life that should receive attention. &nbsp;That's what I want to accomplish this year in addition to continuing my technological advancement pilgrimage. &nbsp;I debated on creating a list by priority, but I decided that everything on this list should get done. &nbsp;I ended up categorizing the items into financial, personal, and technological goals.

Financial Things to Get Done 
- Stick to my budget 
-&nbsp;I'm a failure at sticking to budgets. &nbsp;I spend enormous amounts of time tracking where my money is going, set up a budget, and then buy a digital camera. &nbsp;Or a snowboard. &nbsp;Or a wine fridge. &nbsp;Or some other thing that I probably should have saved up for first. &nbsp;My new strategy is paying myself&nbsp;financially and to use cash when possible. &nbsp;Paying myself first financially means that I put money away before I start paying my bills or buying frivolous things. &nbsp;Using cash helps me to be conscious of where my money is going. &nbsp;Credit cards are evil and they own me. &nbsp;(Hopefully not this year) 
- Save 10% of income 
- Paying myself first will allow me to accomplish the next two goals. &nbsp;There are things I want to save up for in the future. &nbsp;I can't purchase them unless I start saving now. &nbsp;I think 10% is a reasonable number. 
- Save 5% of income for life's experiences&nbsp;
- For the past three years I've never saved money to spend on vacations or things I'm passionate about. &nbsp;I was in the financial bias of saving as much as possible and would feel guilty if I decided to take a trip or spend some cash on something I took pleasure in. No more! &nbsp;Over the past year I've become extremely interested in personal finance. &nbsp;So like I always do when I want to find out more on a subject, I look for reading material, i.e. online blogs. &nbsp;A recurring theme that I found that struck a cord with me was: Spend money on things you value. &nbsp;After all, money is just a tool to live life. &nbsp;So this year I resolve to save money for that snowboarding trip or a trek to foreign country. &nbsp;I'm going to save and spend with no remorse. &nbsp;I'm going to live this time around.

Personal Things to Get Done 
- Continue to pay myself first 
- I recently wrote a blog&nbsp;[paying myself first][4] . &nbsp;I want to continue to go to the gym in the morning. &nbsp; - Read one library book a month&nbsp;- I've been using the library for about a 1.5 months now and I'm going to say that I can't imagine my life without it. &nbsp;I paid 10 dollars for a new library card and the first books I checked out were worth at least twice the library card fee! &nbsp;I've found that I won't have the time to read, but I'm saving money instead of wasting it. I can always renew books I failed to read or just return them and check them out later. &nbsp;The goal here is to continue to read. &nbsp;One book a month is totally doable.
Technical Things To Get Done 
- Play with Python (Really)&nbsp;
- It's time to get off my ass off my crappy chair (My home chair. &nbsp;My work chair rocks!) and learn a new language. &nbsp;I wouldn't say I'm stagnating since I'm still absorbing Ruby and Rails, but I need to get some new code perspectives into my brain this year. &nbsp;Python will be welcomed. 
- Complete 2 resume updates this year 
- The periodic resume updates are a good indicator of my current technical and personal development progress. &nbsp;Stagnation equals Fail. 
- Increase my stackoverflow reputation to 1000!&nbsp;
- I think I'm the most excited about this thing to get done. &nbsp;I've been frequenting&nbsp;[Stack Overflow][5] (SO)&nbsp;for the past couple of weeks and have decided to join the game. &nbsp;I want to raise my reputation points to a certain level before the end of the year. &nbsp;Since it's a game with rules and points, my progress can be measured. &nbsp;I want to have a goal of 1000 reputation points before 2011. &nbsp;I'm at 96 right now. &nbsp;An idea I had to use SO as a learning tool was to try to answer questions in unfamiliar areas. &nbsp;For example, I'm not a pro Rails hacker, but I want to be. &nbsp;So my task is to try to answer Rails questions even if they already have answers. &nbsp;At the end of the day, reputation points don't matter, what I learn does. 
- Practice developing with Ruby on Rails&nbsp;
- It's still here. &nbsp;Rails hacking. &nbsp;It's fun, but I really need to get a move on. &nbsp;I have a side project that I wanted to deploy by the end of 2009, but I failed. &nbsp;Let's shoot for the end of 2010.

Phew. &nbsp;That's a lot to accomplish. Onward!
