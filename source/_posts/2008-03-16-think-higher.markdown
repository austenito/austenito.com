My company's annual performance evaluations ended a couple of weeks ago. In the technical and teamwork 
areas I did fine. The big knock against me was my lack of domain knowledge. I code ok, work hard, try to 
get things done, but I don't have a high level picture of what my work is trying to accomplish. In other 
words, I do what I'm told, but I'm not as helpful when it comes down to figuring out what it is we are 
actually supposed to do.

That turns out to be a huge thing. Stepping up to the next level means getting to that point where you 
are bringing ideas to the table rather than waiting to be served. Sounds easy...right?

So my next task is to figure out how to gain some domain knowledge. How does that even happen?  I can't 
put anything under my pillow in hopes that I'll gain some knowledge from the domain fairy. At my 
Referentia Internship program pitch last Thursday at [UH][1], I told potential interns about the 
importance of gaining domain knowledge. I told them how gaining some domain knowledge will separate them 
from the rest of the pack. I really believe what I said and I'm working on it as we speak.

Over the last two weeks, I've been trying to reach that point where I'm thinking less about implementation and more about solving problems. I'm trying to reach new levels of abstractions. 

I'm trying to Think Higher. 

Rather than wondering what type of design pattern would fit best, I'm trying to move up the thought ladder. What types of things fit into the workflow of our users?  Is this useful? Where should our development focus be?

I am hoping that by changing the way I work, I'll be moving on towards gaining that elusive domain 
knowledge. One of our tech leads at work has been helping me out. In my opinion, his greatest strength 
is this higher thinking process I'm blogging about. He is mentoring me and trying to grow new problem 
solving approaches in me. Hooray for mentors!

So what's next?  I think that the next step would be to Think Higher about Hackystat. Rather than trying to figure out how to implement my DailyProjectDetails viewer in Rails and with cool ajax forms and charts and... It's easy to get lost in the implementation details. I want to start thinking about why would the viewer even be useful?  What types of views and charts and forms would make it easier to provide the information that they needed. What is the purpose of this project?  Once I find that purpose, how can I improve it and make it useful in it's domain?

So add this to the [list][2]. Gain Domain Knowledge. The year is moving by quickly.
