Do you remember the old Hawaii State Public Library Commericial where kids would say?

Well I'm not Hawaiian, but I've decided that I'm going to give the library a chance. Up until this point, 
I told myself that I don't want to use the library. It's such a hassle. Waste of time, energy, resources, 
and space.

I've been reading in personal finance blogs like the[The Simple Dollar][1] about the benefits of using the 
library. A few of my friends have started or are already using the library. One of even suggested I help 
to improve the library's borrow/renewal web UI. An interesting side project.

But I had my doubts. 

- I know they don't carry the latest technology books 
- Driving to and from the library sucks - Will they have the book I'm looking for? 
- I really like to write in my books 
- I'm one of those people that have to have to book just in case there is that one time I _really_ want to 
find something in a book I bought 5 years ago. 
- I bet the hours are inconvenient.

So before I even went down to the library I checked their hours: [Hawaii Public State Library Hour of Operation][2] Woah. They have decent hours. They are even open till 8 PM on some days. So I headed down 
one day after work.

Here is what I found: 

- If my book is at another branch, I can submit a request online to ship the book to the branch of my 
choosing. 
- It really doesn't take that much time to drive to the library. 
- The selection isn't the greatest. 
- They still don't carry the latest technology books. 
- I still can't write in the books.

I was quite pleased with my library visit. I had to purchase a new library card because I must have 
thrown my old card away. When was I ever going to use the library again? So that was $10. It was funny 
because I had a90 fine... from 2001. It's been 8 years and they still kept a record of returning a book 
late. Damn them. 

But it's okay. I spent $10.90 on my library visit, but I get to have an unlimited amount 
of books. The money I save from not having to buy books definitely out weighs the time it takes to drive 
to and from the library. If I reserve my books online I can further reduce the time I spend at the library.
Not to mention that I'm saving space because I don't have to store the books. After years of buying 
books, I notice that my room is cluttered with books that I've read once.

Even if the library doesn't have the technical books that will keep me up to date, I still can purchase those books online at Amazon. I add highlighting, notes to my tech books so it's not a huge deal to buy them. I'm thinking I should try to buy them used instead of new. I don't need the new, clean version of the book. The content is the same.

The library is awesome!

It's too bad they don't have any funding. When I checked out my books, the librarian handed me a flier 
that told me about their furlough days. On the other side of the flier there was an article about a 
fundraiser to support the library. They are obviously in a financial bind.

I'm not sure how to help them. I think donations would help the problem, but would it fix it? Maybe if more people used the library? Who knows, but I'm hoping the library never goes away.
