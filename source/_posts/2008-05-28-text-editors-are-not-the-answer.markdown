Invest the time in mastering development tools, on the other hand, and you won’t want to give these tools up to try a new language —- the development tools are a major part of your productivity. For you, a new language doesn’t have many advantages over other languages anyway, because you haven’t studied how to use language features to make you productive. 

[Josh][1] recently linked a blog post called, [The IDE Divide][2], which made me start ranting to everyone I could find online. If you read it you can clearly see that Oliver Steele is an ultra-biased language maven. I don't understand how he can put people into 2 buckets, either you learn languages feature and are considered a pro-hacker or you use IDEs and suck. He honestly believes in using text editors because you can code anything. I could code using a typewriter and achieve the same effect.

In his diagrams, he shows that you have higher productivity gains if you use a text editor and learn language features rather than learning an IDE and not as much language features. I have two issues with that: 

1. IDEs don't code for you, unless you use Visual Studio (says Josh). You still have to learn the intricacies of the language. Choosing an IDE doesn't lock you into a language. Not having awesome tools may introduce a larger barrier for entry, but it by doesn't stop people from learning new things. IDEs are just tools that help you get your job done. 

2. What happens when you master an IDE?  Do you just sit there and twiddle your thumbs?  Mastering an IDE doesn't take nearly as long as mastering a language. Even if you spent all your time up front learning an IDE, there would still be a lot of time to learn the language. In fact, you don't even need to master an IDE to master a language. Maybe you could use the IDE as just a text editor with some language specific help thrown in.  Now you have the best of both worlds with a very minimal startup cost. That has to be better in the long run.

Hacking is not about knowing a language inside and out or even mastering the tools you use. Hacking is about solving problems. If there is an easier way to get things done, then that is the method you should use. You should always find the right tool for the job. I don't buy the argument that being a language maven helps you to pick the right language for the job. People learn how to use tools and languages together. Being an advocate of languages or tools is not black and white. There is a very large gray area where people are interested in learning both aspects of development.

With that being said, the author is developing his own language so I can understand why he is bashing the people who use IDEs. His language is new and doesn't have very much tool support. Of course he has to use emacs or whatever text editor he chooses.  That doesn't mean IDEs make people suck. Tools are tools. It's how you use them.
