Today as I was reading some blogs on my mobile and sharing stuff, I felt that twinge. That twinge that 
subconsciously tells me, "Hey why are you sharing that? Everyone knows that. People are going to see 
that you shared that and be like WTF." That feeling that overcame me was totally awesome. It's that 
feeling that makes people actually care about the quality of their software. People don't want to let 
their team down. Similarly, I don't want to let you all down by sharing crappy articles. After all, I 
know that you are all like me and are too busy coding, reading, thinking, blogging, and all that other 
stuff  (eating, sleeping, face-to-face interaction) to waste time reading boring articles.

Thinking about it more, sharing is kind of like console gaming. You start up your Nintendo Wii, play some 
Wii Tennis, and dominate. You are a pro. Your rank is as high as it possibly can be. You destroy the 
computer. Then you go to your company summer party and get [pwned][1] by your coworker. (True story)
Sharing items lets you get out of the sandbox. The range of topics you learn about grows out of control. 

You might just find something that interests you. Sharing has totally infected me. Every time I login to 
Google Reader I try to select interesting articles that might spark some interest. Sharing items is like 
an implicit way of blogging. They look at the [items I share on Google Reader][2] and wonder if any of 
the links are worth clicking. Now I have to make sure that I read blogs often, constantly sharing new 
things or else people might stop reading my shared items. What will they think of me? Sharing is 
important, but so is the stuff that is being shared.
