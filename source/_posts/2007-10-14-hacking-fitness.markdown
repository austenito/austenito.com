I have read numerous articles in Muscle and Fitness that explain why body building is so tough. Body builders often talk about difficulties in being meticulous in what they eat, how they train, and their supplement cycles. The most important point they bring up is that body building isn't a job, it's a lifestyle.

In my opinion, hacking should be the same way. Hacking isn't just something you do at work to pay the bills. You need to always be improving your "Hacking Fitness". I believe that in order to become an awesome hacker, you need to change the way you live. You need to constantly train your mind to think in code, refine your hacking skills, and keep improving. English (or your native tongue) should be your second language.

Another thing to improve your Hacking Fitness is to find the right motivation. You have to _want_ to improve. If hacking is your hobby, then you'll be hacking at home. If you are hacking at home you are already have a leg up on a lot of developers. You have effectively turned "work" into "play", which to me is the real key of improving your Hacking Fitness.

Some other miscellaneous items that I am doing to try improve my Hacking Fitness: 

1. Read books. You must read. There is no way that you can learn effectively without bombarding your brain with the stuff found in all of the reading material out there. There is absolutely no excuse not to read blogs, books, magazines. If you are awesome and not reading, let me know how you do it. 

2. Read other peoples code. You can learn bunches of things when you read another developer's code. Improving your code reading skills will increase the speed at which you figure out things. Just imagine what it would be like writing a book report when you had trouble reading the book. It's hard to make connections when there is a language barrier. The same applies to reading code. 

3. Pair program and Pair review. I have found that learning how other people think about code and their code tracing process is very useful. While pair programming is not useful all the time (although some people swear by pair programming), I find that after you experience it with another developer, you start to think like them when you are coding. I noticed this a while back when I started to trace through code like my coworker. You start wrapping the code around your head in different ways. You see the little things that you would not have seen before. Totally useful. 

4. Try new things. I try not to get stuck using the same tools all the time. I try to move over to something new to see what is out there. For example, I was using the Netbeans IDE for a bit. You can't find anything better if you aren't looking.

A lot of these things have been said before. You need to keep learning, you need to get motivated, blah blah blah. If you take anything away from this blog, it should be that:

Hacking isn't a job, it's a lifestyle.
