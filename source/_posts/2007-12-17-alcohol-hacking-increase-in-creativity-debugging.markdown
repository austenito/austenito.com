title: "Alcohol + Hacking != Increase in Creativity/Debugging"

Tonight I tried a little experiment that involved a martini and some code. I have read and heard about
the glorious effects of alcohol on the ability to think differently while hacking. Alcohol supposedly can 
provide you with some "liquid creativity". Much like the "liquid confidence" we are all familiar with, 
especially at those late night karaoke parties. Thinking outside the box can be yours when you grab some 
booze and start hacking. All ready to be ultra productive, I had some of my drink and started coding. 

Here is what I thought would happen:

`
"Hey I see what this code is doing! Let's try something new. Why not. What else do I have to lose. Code code code hack hack hack. This is great! I should drink and code at work!"
`

Here is what really happened:

`
"Oh god I just deleted all of the class again. CTRL + Z. Grrrr why can't I type correctly. Why doesn't 
this work???? I totally wrote a unit test and now its failing. I didn't type anything. CTRL + Z AGAIN. 
What was that class called again? Search search search fix typo fix typo backspace backspeace

This was after half a martini. I'm a lightweight drinker, but this was ridiculous. My motor skills were 
not kicking in tonight when I was trying to code. Even when I had to figure out why something was 
working, I felt no difference in my ability to debug. I actually got more frustrated cause it didn't make 
sense. My thinking was just clouded from the alcohol. Worst hacking experience. ever.

(You Hackystat hackers out there know I tried doing this the day before our we get ready for the public 
release. It's ok. Unit tests pass. Woohoo!)
