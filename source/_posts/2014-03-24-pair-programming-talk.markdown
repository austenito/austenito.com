"Pair program and Pair review. I have found that learning how other people think about code and their code tracing process is very useful. While pair programming is not useful all the time (although some people swear by pair programming), I find that after you experience it with another developer, you start to think like them when you are coding. I noticed this a while back when I started to trace through code like my coworker. You start wrapping the code around your head in different ways. You see the little things that you would not have seen before. Totally useful."


I really love pair programming. When I was in college, I heard about this new fangled extreme
programming thing. We did some of it. Code reviews with 
[Jupiter](https://code.google.com/p/jupiter-eclipse-plugin/) and unit testing with jUnit. It
seemed like a great thing. When I moved on to LivingSocial, we did the github pull request thing.
That also seemed like a great thing. We reviewed each others code all the time. It worked out
pretty well. I got to write nice pull requests and read a lot of code.

Then I started work at Kitchensurfing. And we pair all day, everyday. My eyes were opened. It's
such an amazing feeling to have context on a lot of aspects of the system. I'm learning everyday
from my pair. I feel like I'm pushing coding brain to the limit all the time. It's fun. I'm
silly with my pair. We have funny pair photos. 

I loved it so much that I gave a talk at [HI Capacity](http://hicapacity.org/) about how we 
pair program at [Kitchensurfing](http://kitchensurfing.com).

I thought the talk went well. One of my favorite points of the talk was how we don't do
pull requests at Kitchensurfing. My previous experience and open source experience was that
pull requests are great. They let you asynchronously reviews peoples code. 

That doesn't work in our process. Pair programming is continous review and we have no need for
pull requests. We get a ton more insight by pairing that reading a pull request.
Most of the time pull requests end up being this thing where you say, "hey add some tests" or
"this styling is bad". That's not really helpful and doesn't produce the result we want.

What we want is the ability to say, hey that code looks great. Let's ship that. How about
we architect this a certain way. What's the simplest thing we can do?

What's the naive approach? Who knows if this code is going to be around for much longer?
