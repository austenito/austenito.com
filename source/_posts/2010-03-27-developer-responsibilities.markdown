I think Eric Sink got it right. [We Need Developers, Not Programmers][1] . In the article, he writes about needing developers who know how to be flexible and understand the software lifecycle instead of coders that are one trick ponies. &nbsp;You know who I'm talking about. &nbsp;Those programmers who know how to write some source and nothing else. &nbsp;Improve the build environment? Work on continuos integration? &nbsp;Unit test? &nbsp;Write wikis to help the team? Mentor? &nbsp;Contribute to the awesome company culture? Forget about it.Working for a small company, I completely agree with that statement. &nbsp;I'm glad that I work at a company that allows me to have a hand in everything. &nbsp;My tasks during the week range from development environment scripting to application deployment to middleware hacking to pretty front end stuff to ensuring code quality to maintaining our build server. &nbsp;Then&nbsp;I get to write down what I've done to help out the rest of the team on our company wiki. &nbsp;My hard work is rewarded with my #1 status&nbsp;on the&nbsp;[Continuos Integration Game][2] &nbsp;leaderboard. &nbsp;Having my hand in everything is awesome becauseI'm learning tons everyday!As a developer, that's something to strive for. Especially if you're a developer that's fresh out of school. &nbsp;When you get out of college, you want to absorb as much as possible. &nbsp;Can you do that at a big company? &nbsp;Maybe. &nbsp;Is it easier at a smaller company? &nbsp;Totally. As a developer, you have a mound of responsibilities other than whipping out lines of source. &nbsp;Specializing in something is great, but being an agile developer is much more useful to your peers. &nbsp;If you understand the different aspects of software, you can apply your knowledge to challenges you face in every facet of development. &nbsp;I've learned over the years that just being familiar with what people are talking is HUGE. &nbsp;It gives you a basis when you start learning new stuff on [The Google][3] . &nbsp;The only way to get to that nice and comfy "I've heard of that before" place is to dive into as many new things as possible.Staying agile is important and a small company helps you do that. &nbsp;It helps you and your team get things done.And isn't that what it's all about? Solving problems, improving customers lives, and rocking out to an awesome product.
