The last week and a half was spent editing a proposal for the [Netbeans Innovators Grant][1], which 
awards developers with $2000 or $11,500 to work on a project that will benefit the Netbeans community. 
The idea that one of my team members had was to write a port of Jupiter to Netbeans.  What a great idea! 
Our company performs code reviews and it is a huge pain to moderate the review when half of the reviewers 
are using pen and paper and the other half is using [Jupiter][2]  Don't worry.  I'm really am writing a 
blog about proposing to get a grant to work on Netbeans.  I may be an Eclipse fan boy, I am also a huge 
proponent of using the right tool for the job.  If one day Netbeans leaps over Eclipse, I'll be the first 
one to switch.  I think that the Netbeans team did an awesome job integrating Ruby on Rails development. 
 I am currently am writing a  DailyProjectDetails viewer using rails.  I put the Hackystat mini-feed on 
hold, while I try to pump out a useful view that we can use at work.  The viewer should be appearing in 
another blog as soon as I get something that can be deployed.

Getting back to the Netbeans grant, I thought the whole process was enjoyable and painful at the same time.
I must admit that writing proposals suck.  I have helped to write a bunch at work and took the lead on 
the Netbeans proposal.  It sucks because it is mentally draining and you spend so much time getting the 
flow and content just right.  I literally spent hours searching online for current review tool research 
and solutions.   The enjoyable part is the end goal.  The motivation factor.  I really do believe that we 
can work together to create something useful.  If I can spend a week living in pain to have 4 months of 
fun working together on a project, then I will sit there and pump out proposals all day long ;) Working on 
this proposal helped me realize that proposal writing is skill that everyone should have.  Originally I 
thought that writing proposals were not for me.  Why should I write proposals?  I'm a hacker, just let me 
hack.  I'm never going to need to have this proposal writing skill.  It is a good thing that I got some 
proposal writing practice because it turned out to be extremely useful. 

"What is the current technologies that exist in your proposed area?"

"What is our project's special sauce?" 

The two questions above were implanted in my brain and helped me to write the proposal.  I used those two 
questions to help me find justification for writing the proposal.  I looked for the current integrated 
review tool solutions and pitched our idea.  I then talked about what our "special sauce" could be.  I 
really believe that the project is do-able and provides value.   

 Hopefully the Netbeans grant team wants to drink our Jupiter Kool-Aid too.  It tastes great.
