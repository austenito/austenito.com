Wow. My last post was back in May. It's been a while since I've made time for this blog thing, but it's been a good sabbatical. I'm reemerging on the interweb for the third time and hopefully here to stay. I want to stay committed and vigilant, as we all know how difficult it is to be an active blogger. My plan of posting twice a week turned into posting once a week, which then turned into not posting. Plan failure. But I have a new and improved plan!

One day I had a 6 AM gym session with a friend. It changed my life. My schedule used to look like this: 

- 9:00 AM  Wake up 
- 9:05 AM  Go to Work 
- 7:00 PM  Read blogs, Side Project Work 
- 10:00 PM Hit the Gym

By the time I started working on my personal improvement tasks I would be tired and unfocused. I was amazed at how one morning gym session would make the rest of my day was incredible. I felt great. I didn't need to have 6 cups of coffee or some sugar to get through the day. My metabolism was in overdrive. I couldn't believe how awesome it was to start your day off with a workout.

So I changed my schedule: 
- 5:45 AM Hit the Gym 
- 7:45 AM Read blogs, Learn some cool stuff 
- 7:00 PM  Watch video blogs, listen to podcasts, take a break 
- 10:30 PM Sleep

Then one morning I found a blog that talked about [Paying Yourself First][1] What an excellent idea. I've always struggled with spending too much at the beginning of the month or when I get my paycheck. This is a great idea. Pay myself first. 

Light Bulb.

My updated scheduled: 
- 5:45 AM Hit the Gym 
- 7:45 AM Write a blog 
- 7:00 PM Read blogs, Learn some cool stuff, Work on side projects,Watch video blogs, Listen to podcasts, Take a Break 
- 10:30 PM Sleep

So my new goal is to do some writing before I head to work. I don't have to write a complete blog or always try to finish existing blog. My goal is to jot down my ideas. If I can write down what I'm thinking about I should be able to get a blog out every week.

I honestly rather do my side project hacking in the morning when I'm the freshest, but I don't have enough time between my gym session and when I need to leave for the job. Once the tasking at work calms down a bit, I should be able to resume my Rails hacking.

A while ago I read an article by Sid Savara, [Paying Myself First With My Time][2]. I didn't buy into it then. How could I wake up early and start my day like that? Crazy Talk.

_Best Idea Ever_.
